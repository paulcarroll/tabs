          C                         F                    C    C7
I got the blues from my baby livin' by the San Francisco Bay
    F                        C      C7
The ocean liners not so far away
  F                                            C                     A7
I didn't mean to treat her so bad; she was the best girl I ever have had
  D7/F#
I said goodbye; I can take a cry
G7
   I wanna lay down and die



  C                        F                   C
I ain't got a nickle and I ain't got a lousy dime
    F                                      E7
She don't come back; ain't gonna lose my mind
       F                                C                    A7
If ya' ever get back to stay it's gonna be another brand new day
D7/F#                     G7                    C
Walkin' with my baby down by the San Francisco Bay

C            F                C                        F      C
Sittin' down lookin' from the back door wondrin' which way to go
F                                                C
   Woman I'm so crazy 'bout she don't love me no more
F                                  C                  A7
Think I'll catch me a freight train cause I'm feelin' blue
D7/F#                                  G7
Ride all the way to the end of the line  thinkin' only you
C         F             C                   F   C
Meanwhile livin' in the city just about to go insane
     F                           E7
All I heard my baby Lord wishin' you would call my name
     F                                C                    A7
If I ever get back to stay it's gonna be another brand new day
D7/F#                    G7                    C        A7
Walkin with my baby down by the San Francisco Bay
D7/F#                    G7                    C        A7
Walkin with my baby down by the San Francisco Bay
      D7/F#                    G7                    C    F    C  G  C
Yeah, walkin with my baby down by the San Francisco Bay
