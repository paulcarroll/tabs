## Verse

F#                                        C#
I’d like to say goodbye to a complicated mind,
&nbsp;                 B                                                                  F#
but when I walk and wave I’m stalked all day by California lives
F#                           C#                              A       B                     F#
And things I didn’t try, ways you were unkind… and the strangest coloured eyes

Out in the corner
D                B                               F#
Out in the corner
A                B                               F#
