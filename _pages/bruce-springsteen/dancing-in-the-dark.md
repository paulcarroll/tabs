D
I get up in the evening and I ain't got nothing to say
&nbsp;                                                        G
I come home in the morning  I go to bed feeling the same way
&nbsp;                                                                  D
I ain't nothing but tired      Man I'm just tired and bored with myself
&nbsp;                                              A
Hey there Baby    I could use just a little help

## Chorus
A                                                       G
You can't start a fire, you can't start a fire without a spark
&nbsp;                G                                       D
This gun's for hire  even if we're just dancing in the dark

## Verse
D
Messages keep getting clearer, radio's on and I'm moving round my place
&nbsp;                                                                       G
I check my look in the mirror I wanna change my hair, my clothes, my face

Man I ain't getting nowhere, I'm just living in a dump like this

## Bridge
D
There's something happening somewhere.
something happening somewhere
something happening somewhere
something happening somewhere

## Chorus
A                                                       G
You can't start a fire, you can't start a fire without a spark
&nbsp;                G                                       D
This gun's for hire  even if we're just dancing in the dark

## Outro
D (riff)

[Build.. on D]

A                                                         G
You can't start a fire sitting round crying over a broken heart
&nbsp;                G                                         A
This gun's for hire   even if we're just dancing in the   dark
&nbsp;                                                                G
You can't start a fire worrying about your little world falling apart
&nbsp;                    G                                   D
This gun's for hire   even if we're just dancing in the dark
