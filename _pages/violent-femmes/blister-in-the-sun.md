G            C       G          C     G       C         G

I'm high as a kite, I just might stop to check you out...

Let me go on, big hands I know your the one...
G    C      G           C      G       C         G
Body beats, I stain my sheets, I don't even know why
G       C     G          C    G       C          G
My girlfriend she at the end, she is starting to cry...

Let me go on, big hands I know your the one...
