## Intro

A D A D A D E

## Verse

A                   D
I'm gnawing on the knowledge
A                 D
That I have been burnt
&nbsp;       A                   D
And I'm learning things that I
&nbsp;       A         D
Should've already learnt
A               D
Everyone I ever knew
A               D
Was so kind and coy
A            D
I was with a girl
&nbsp;           A                 D
But it felt like I was with a boy

## Chorus

A
I can't even remember
D
If we were lovers
&nbsp;  A                E
Or if I just wanted to
&nbsp;     A
But I held her in my arms
&nbsp; D
I held her in my arms
&nbsp; A
I held her in my arms
&nbsp;             E
But it wasn't you

## Interlude

*Play intro chord progression*

A D A D A D E

## Verse

A           D
I will not kill
&nbsp;   A                D
The one thing that I love
A                D
In this world of wreckage
A        D
I look above
A        D
Help me Lord
A            D
Help me understand
A                 D
What it means to be a boy
A                 D
What it means to be a man

## Chorus

A
I can't even remember
D
If we were lovers
&nbsp;  A                E
Or if I just wanted to
&nbsp;     A
But I held her in my arms
&nbsp; D
I held her in my arms
&nbsp; A
I held her in my arms
&nbsp;             E
But it wasn't you
