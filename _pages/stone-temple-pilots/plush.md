## Verse

G      D/F#      F               C
 And I feel that time's a wasted go
EbM7/G             FM7/A
 So where ya going to
G                D/F#     F                 C
 tomorrow? And I see that these are lies to come
EbM7/G         FM7/A  D
 Would you even care?

## Pre-chorus

D Cadd2 G Cadd2

&nbsp;     D     Cadd2 G Cadd2
 And I feel it

D Cadd2 G Cadd2

&nbsp;     D    Cadd2 G Cadd2
And I feel it

## Chorus

EbM7/G              FM7/A
 Where ya going for tomorrow?
EbM7/G                    FM7/A
 Where ya going with that mask I found?
EbM7/G                            FM7/A
 And I feel, and I feel, when the dogs begin to smell her
EbM7/G             FM7/A
 Will she smell alone?

## Verse

G      D/F#     F                   C
 And I feel, so much depends on the weather
EbM7/G               FM7/A
 So is it raining in your
G               D/F#     F                      C
 bedroom? And I see, that these are the eyes of disarray
EbM7/G         FM7/A  D
 Would you even care?

D Cadd2 G Cadd2

And I feel it

 Will she smell alone?
G5        F5              C3/E
 When the dogs do find her
           Eb5          D5               ----- When you play the Eb5 quickly slide up from a D5
 Got time, time, to wait for
G5        F5          C3/E       Eb5 D5
 tomorrow, to find it, to find it, to find it
G5        F5              C3/E
 When the dogs do find her
           Eb5          D5
 Got time, time, to wait for
G5        F5          C3/E        Eb5       D5
 tomorrow, to find it, to find it,    to find it
