Opening
C   B7(open E)  Em     |  C    B7    Em
    e|--0--|                e|--2--|
    B|--0--|                B|--0--|
    G|--2--|                G|--2--|
    D|--1--|                D|--1--|
    A|--2--|                A|--2--|
    E|--x--|                E|--x--|

*   Alternate the B7(Open E) and the B7 in the verse.
**  When playing Em in the bridge, you can alternate the chord by holding B string
(3rd Fret) and high E string (3rd fret) back and forth.
*** I am well aware the last line of the bridge has a variance on the C to D. I
found this the easiest way to play it however.

## Verse

 Em           C    B7               Em
Forward yesterday makes me want to stay
 Em                 C     B7               Em
What they said was real, makes me want to steal
 Em           C           B7               Em
Living under house, yes I'm living I'm a mouse
 Em           C             B7               Em
All I got is time, got no meaning just a rhyme

## Bridge

G                Am                      Em
Take time with a wounded hand, cause it likes to heal
G                Am                     Em
Take time with a wounded hand, guess I like to steal
G                Am                     C                  D
Take time with a wounded hand, cause it likes to heal, I like to steal***

Friends don't mean a thing, guess I'll leave it up to me
