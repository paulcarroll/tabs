## Verse

C                  E7            A7
Once I lived the life of a millionaire
Dm                A7          Dm        A7
Spending all my money didn't have any cares
F                              C           A7
Took all my friends out for a mighty good time
D7                            G7
We bought bootleg liquor, champagne and wine

## Verse

C         E7          A7
Then I began to fall so low
Dm            A7              Dm          A7
Lost all my good friends, had no where to go
F                         C      A7
If I get my hands on a dollar again
D7                                 G7
I'll hang on to it, till that old eagle grins

## Chorus

C          E     A7
Because nobody knows you
Dm           A7      Dm    A7
When you're down and out
F          D7    C         A7
In your pocket, not one penny
C                         G
And as for friends, you don't have any.
C              E                A7
When you get back on your feet again
Dm         A7               Dm           A7
Everybody wants to be your long lost friend
F             D7        C          A7
I said it strange, without any doubt
C                             G
Nobody knows you, when your down and out.

## Chorus

C          E     A7
â€˜cause nobody knows you
Dm           A7      Dm    A7
When you're down and out
F          D7    C         A7
In your pocket, not one penny
C                         G              C
And as for friends, you don't have any
