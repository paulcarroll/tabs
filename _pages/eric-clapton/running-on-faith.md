## Verse 1

G                D/F#       Em       D/F#
Lately I've been running on faith
G               D/F#     Em    G7
What else can a poor boy do
       C                       D
But my world will be right
                     G     C     D     D7
When Love comes over me

## Verse 2

G                D/F#          Em        D/F#
Lately I've been talking in my sleep
G                        D/F#    Em      G7
I can't imaging what I'd have to say
          C                        D
Except my world wouldn't be right
                          G     C    G    G7
When Love comes back your way 

## Chorus 1

C           B7
I've always been
Em     G7                 C       C/B
One to take each and everyday
A
seems like by now
                  C                     D      D7
I find a love who cares, cares just for me

## Verse 3

G                D/F#       Em       D/F#
Then we'd  go running on faith
G               D/F#     Em    G7
All of our dreams would come true
       C                       D
And our world will be right
                     G     C     D     D7
When Love comes over me and you
