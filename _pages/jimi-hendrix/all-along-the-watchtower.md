```
Alternate chords: Cm   B♭   A♭
or just use them in the intro to mix the tone up a bit in the solos

The other capo tunings are: 

- 3 as Hendrix played it
- 4 as Dylan played it

and play the alternate "Hendrix chords", but *not* relative to capo
```

## Verse 1

```
Am               G                F          G
  There must be some kind of way out of here,
Am            G          F     G
  Said the joker to the thief.
Am                 G        F    G
  There's too much confusion;
Am        G        F    G
  I can't get no relief.
Am             G          F            G
  Business men they, they drink my wine,
Am        G        F    G
  Plowmen dig my earth.
Am        G       F         G
  None of them along the line.
Am            G           F     G
  Know what any of it is worth.
```

## Verse 2

```
Am          G         F     G
  No reason to get excited,
Am              G            F    G
  The thief, he kindly spoke.
Am               G          F     G
  There are many here among us
Am               G             F     G
  Who feel that life is but a joke,
Am            G        F                G
  But you and I, we've been through that
Am            G       F    G
  And this is not our fate,
Am           G           F           G
  So let us stop talking falsely now -
Am            G         F    G
  The hour is getting late.
```

## Verse 3

```
Am   G          F        G
All along the watchtower
Am        G           F    G
  Princes kept the view
Am              G       F           G
  While all the women came and went,
Am         G         F    G
  barefoot servants too.
Am      G           F        G
Outside in the cold distance
Am          G      F    G
  a wildcat did growl.
Am           G             F    G
  Two riders were approaching
        Am     G         F    G
and the wind began to howl.
```
