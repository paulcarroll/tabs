## Intro

```chordpro
G
Am   G   F   G   x4
```

## Verse
Am               G                F          G
&nbsp; There must be some kind of way out of here,
Am            G          F     G
&nbsp; Said the joker to the thief.
Am                 G        F    G
&nbsp; There's too much confusion;
Am        G        F    G
&nbsp; I can't get no relief.
Am             G          F            G
&nbsp; Business men they, they drink my wine,
Am        G        F    G
&nbsp; Plowmen dig my earth.
Am        G       F         G
&nbsp; None of them along the line.
Am            G           F     G
&nbsp; Know what any of it is worth.

## Solo

```chordpro
Am   G   F   G   x4
```

## Verse
Am          G         F     G
&nbsp; No reason to get excited,
Am              G            F    G
&nbsp; The thief, he kindly spoke.
Am               G          F     G
&nbsp; There are many here among us
Am               G             F     G
&nbsp; Who feel that life is but a joke,
Am            G        F                G
&nbsp; But you and I, we've been through that
Am            G       F    G
&nbsp; And this is not our fate,
Am           G           F           G
&nbsp; So let us stop talking falsely now -
Am            G         F    G
&nbsp; The hour is getting late.

## Solo

```chordpro

```

## Verse
Am   G          F        G
All along the watchtower
Am        G           F    G
&nbsp; Princes kept the view
Am              G       F           G
&nbsp; While all the women came and went,
Am         G         F    G
&nbsp; barefoot servants too.
Am      G           F        G
Outside in the cold distance
Am          G      F    G
&nbsp; a wildcat did growl.
Am           G             F    G
&nbsp; Two riders were approaching
&nbsp;       Am     G         F    G
and the wind began to howl.
