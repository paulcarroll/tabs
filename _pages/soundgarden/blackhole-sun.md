## Intro

E G D C#m C B

## Verse

&nbsp;     E           G
In my eyes, indisposed
&nbsp;      D             C#m
In disguises no one knows.
&nbsp;          C               B
Hides the face, lies the snake
&nbsp;    E     D       F
The sun in my disgrace.
&nbsp;        E             G
Boiling heat, summer stench
&nbsp;           D                  C#m
Neath the black the sky looks dead.
&nbsp;        C                 B
Call my name through the cream
&nbsp;         E        D       F
And I'll hear you scream again.

## Chorus

&nbsp;           C
Black hole sun
&nbsp;          B
Won't you come
&nbsp;    E     D       G
And wash away the rain.
&nbsp;           C
Black hole sun
&nbsp;          B               A               B
Won't you come, won't you come, won't you come.

## Verse

&nbsp;      E              G
Stuttering, cold and damp
&nbsp;          D                C#m
Steal the warm wind tired friend.
&nbsp;          C               B
Times are gone for honest men
&nbsp;              E      D          F
And sometimes far too long for snakes.
&nbsp;       E                G
In my shoes, a walking sleep
&nbsp;       D               C#m
And my youth I pray to keep.
&nbsp;       C          B
Heaven sent hell away
&nbsp;       E          D      F
No one sings like you anymore.

## Chorus

&nbsp;           C
Black hole sun
&nbsp;          B
Won't you come
&nbsp;    E     D       G
And wash away the rain.
&nbsp;           C
Black hole sun
&nbsp;          B               A    G
Won't you come, won't you come.

&nbsp;           C
Black hole sun
&nbsp;          B
Won't you come
&nbsp;    E     D       G
And wash away the rain.
&nbsp;           C
Black hole sun
&nbsp;          B
Won't you come
&nbsp;          A                G               B
Won't you come (Black hole sun, Black hole sun).
&nbsp;          A                Em              B
Won't you come (Black hole sun, Black hole sun).
&nbsp;          A                G               B
Won't you come (Black hole sun, Black hole sun).
&nbsp;          A                Em              B
Won't you come (Black hole sun, Black hole sun).

## Bridge

&nbsp;        E              G
Hang my head, drown my fear
&nbsp;        D              C#m
Till you all just disappear.

And wash away the rain.
&nbsp;           C
Black hole sun

Won't you come, won't you come.

&nbsp;           C

&nbsp;          B
Won't you come

And wash away the rain.

Black hole sun
&nbsp;          B
Won't you come
&nbsp;          A                G               B
Won't you come (Black hole sun, Black hole sun).
&nbsp;          A                G               B
Won't you come (Black hole sun, Black hole sun).
&nbsp;          A                G               B
Won't you come (Black hole sun, Black hole sun).
