## Intro

E G D C#m C B

## Verse

      E           G
In my eyes, indisposed
       D             C#m
In disguises no one knows.
           C               B
Hides the face, lies the snake
     E     D       F
The sun in my disgrace.
         E             G
Boiling heat, summer stench
            D                  C#m
Neath the black the sky looks dead.
         C                 B
Call my name through the cream
          E        D       F
And I'll hear you scream again.

## Chorus

            C
Black hole sun
           B
Won't you come
     E     D       G
And wash away the rain.
            C
Black hole sun
           B               A               B
Won't you come, won't you come, won't you come.

## Verse

       E              G
Stuttering, cold and damp
           D                C#m
Steal the warm wind tired friend.
           C               B
Times are gone for honest men
               E      D          F
And sometimes far too long for snakes.
        E                G
In my shoes, a walking sleep
        D               C#m
And my youth I pray to keep.
        C          B
Heaven sent hell away
        E          D      F
No one sings like you anymore.

## Chorus

            C
Black hole sun
           B
Won't you come
     E     D       G
And wash away the rain.
            C
Black hole sun
           B               A    G
Won't you come, won't you come.

            C
Black hole sun
           B
Won't you come
     E     D       G
And wash away the rain.
            C
Black hole sun
           B
Won't you come
           A                G               B
Won't you come (Black hole sun, Black hole sun).
           A                Em              B
Won't you come (Black hole sun, Black hole sun).
           A                G               B
Won't you come (Black hole sun, Black hole sun).
           A                Em              B
Won't you come (Black hole sun, Black hole sun).

## Bridge

         E              G
Hang my head, drown my fear
         D              C#m
Till you all just disappear.

## Chorus

            C
Black hole sun

     E     D       G
And wash away the rain.
            C
Black hole sun
           B               A    G
Won't you come, won't you come.

            C
Black hole sun
           B
Won't you come
     E     D       G
And wash away the rain.
            C
Black hole sun
           B
Won't you come
           A                G               B
Won't you come (Black hole sun, Black hole sun).
           A                G               B
Won't you come (Black hole sun, Black hole sun).
           A                G               B
Won't you come (Black hole sun, Black hole sun).
           A                G               B
Won't you come (Black hole sun, Black hole sun).
           A                G               B
Won't you come (Black hole sun, Black hole sun).
           A                G               B

Won't you come.
