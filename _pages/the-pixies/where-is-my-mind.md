## Intro

&nbsp; E  C#m  G#  A (4x)

## Verse
&nbsp;          E                        C#m               G#  A
 With your feet in the air and your head on the ground
E    C#m            G#       A
 Try this trick and spin it, yeah
E                  C#m                G#
 Your head will collapse  But there's nothing in it
&nbsp;          A
And you'll ask yourself

## Chorus
E            C#m      G#           A
 Where is my mind?    Where is my mind?

 Where is my mind?

E  C#m  G#  A
E   G#         A             Am        C#m   B
Way out in the water, see it swimming.

I was swimmin' in the atlantic Carribean
Animals were hiding behind the rock
Except the little fish
But they told me, he swears
Tryin' to talk to me, to me, to me

## Chorus
E            C#m
 Where is my mind?
G#           A
 Where is my mind?
&nbsp;    E       C#m   G#  A
 Where is my mind?

## Verse

 With your feet in the air and your head on the ground
E    C#m            G#       A
 Try this trick and spin it, yeah
E                  C#m
 Your head will collapse
&nbsp;           G#
But there's nothing in it
&nbsp;          A
And you'll ask yourself

## Chorus
E            C#m
 Where is my mind?
G#           A
 Where is my mind?
&nbsp;    E       C#m   G#  A
 Where is my mind?
