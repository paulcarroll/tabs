## Verse

E5 (riff)
E5
Sitting here wishing on a cement floor
&nbsp;    G5                      E5
Just wishing that I had just something you wore
G5     E5        G5     E5
Put it on when I go lonely
&nbsp;        Am            C         D          E5
Will you take off your dress and send it to me?

## Verse

E5 (riff)
E5
I miss your kissin' and I miss your head
&nbsp;      G5                             E5
And a letter in your writing doesn't mean you're not dead
G5       E5          G5     E5
Run outside in the desert heat
&nbsp;          Am        C       D         E5
Make your dress all wet and send it to me

## Verse

E5 (riff)
E5
I miss your soup and I miss your bread
&nbsp;      G5                             E5
And a letter in your writing doesn't mean you're not dead
G5              E5           G5        E5
So spill your breakfast and drip your wine
&nbsp;    Am         C         D     E5
Just wear that dress when you dine

## Verse

E5 (riff)
E5
Sitting here wishing on a cement floor
&nbsp;      G5                             E5
Just wishing that I had just something you wore
G5       E5          G5     E5
Bloody your hands on a cactus tree
&nbsp;  Am             C          D        E5
Wipe it on your dress and send it to me
