## Verse

F           A              Bb       G7  Bb-A-G7-F
Ceased to resist, given my goodbyes
F        A            Bb    G7    Bb-A-G7-F
Drove my car into the ocean
F        A               Bb    G7
You think I'm dead but I sail away

## Chorus

&nbsp;    F       A    Bb    F       A    Bb    F       A    Bb
On a wave of mutilation wave of mutilation wave of mutilation
F    Bb
Wave
F    Bb
Wave

## Verse

I've kissed mermaids, rode the el nino
walked the sand with the crustaceans
could find my way to mariana

## Chorus

on a wave of mutilation,
wave of mutilation
wave of mutilation
wave

wave of mutilation
wave
