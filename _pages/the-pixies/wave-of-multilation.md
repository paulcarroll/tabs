Ceased to resist, given my goodbyes
F        A            Bb    G7    Bb-A-G7-F
Drove my car into the ocean
F	      A               Bb    G7
You think I'm dead but I sail away

On a wave of mutilation wave of mutilation wave of mutilation
F    Bb
Wave

Wave

i've kissed mermaids, rode the el nino
walked the sand with the crustaceans
could find my way to mariana
on a wave of mutilation,
wave of mutilation
wave of mutilation
wave

wave of mutilation
wave
