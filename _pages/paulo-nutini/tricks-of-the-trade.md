## Intro

C  Em  F  F (2X)

## Verse

         C
Was it love or recognition that
     Em
has healed this man's condition
      F
I'm hoping and I'm wishing that
      G
this bird won't fly away
C
We can see life hand in hand
     Em
the green, the blue, the rough, the sand
    F
And in our time and in our land
        G
we'll savor everyday

## Chorus

    Am                     C    Em
And oh, how our glory may fade away, well
     F
at least we've learned
      G               C   Em   F   F
some things along the way

## Verse 2

     C
You took me from my bubble
        Em
knowing my defense was weak
         F
And you sat there and you listened
     G
any time I chose to speak
      C
you gathered from my pleas to
     Em
you that I am but a clown
        F                    G
And I fear only a hero can defeat

these demons now

## Chorus 2

    Am                     C    Em
And oh, how our glory may fade away, well
     F
at least we've learned some
  G         C
tricks of trade

## Instrumental

Em  F  F  C  Em  F  F

## Outro

Am                                C   Em
And as time shall inevitably move on, mmmmh well then
     F
at least we'll have four strong
          G
legs to stand on
             C
To keep us alive...
