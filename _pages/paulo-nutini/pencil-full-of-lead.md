## Verse

D
I’ve got a sheet for my bed and a pillow for my head
I’ve got a pencil full of lead and some water for my throat
&nbsp;                G
I’ve got buttons for my coat; and sails on my boat
&nbsp;  D
So much more than I needed before
&nbsp;       A                       G
I got money in the meter and a two bar heater
D
Now it’s getting hotter Oh it’s only getting sweeter
I got legs on my chair and a head full of hair
Pot and a pan And some shoes on my feet
&nbsp;          G
I got a shelf full of books and most of my teeth
&nbsp;  D
A few pairs of socks and a door with a lock
&nbsp;      A                                      G
I got food in my belly and a license for my telly
&nbsp;         D
And nothing's gonna bring me down

## Instrumental

D, G, D, A, G, D

## Verse

D
I got a nice guitar and tyres on my car
I got most of the means; and scripts for the scenes
&nbsp;    G
I’m out and about, so I’m in with a shout
&nbsp;       D
I got a fair bit of chat but better than that
A                       G
Food in my belly and a license for my telly
&nbsp;   D
and nothing's going to bring me down

## Instrumental

D, G, D, A, G, D

## Verse

Nothing's gonna bring me down
 D
But best of all (best of all)... I’ve got my baby
&nbsp;  G
But best of all (best of all)
&nbsp;                     D
I’ve got my baby
&nbsp;              A                                G
She's mighty fine and says she's all mine
&nbsp;           D
And nothing's going to bring me down
&nbsp;              A                                G
She's mighty fine and says she's all mine
&nbsp;           D
And nothing's going to bring me down
&nbsp;              A                                G
She's mighty fine and says she's all mine
&nbsp;           D                          A   D
And nothing's going to bring me down
