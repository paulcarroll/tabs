## Verse

&nbsp;   E          B
Her name is Noelle
E            A
I have a dream about her.
E             B
She rings my bell.
      E              A
I got gym class in half an hour.
E            B
Oh, how she rocks
   E              A
In keds and tube socks
&nbsp;   C#m          A          B
But she doesn't know who I am
&nbsp;   C#m          A      B
And she doesn't give a damn about me.

## Verse

&nbsp;   E           B
Her boyfriend's a dick
E            A
and he brings a gun to school
E             B
And he'd simply kick
  E              A
My ass if he knew the truth.
E            B
He lives on my block
E            A
And he drives an Iroc
    C#m          A          B
But he doesn't know who I am
    C#m          A          B
And he doesn't give a damn about me.
