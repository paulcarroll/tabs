C F 2x *

## Verse

&nbsp; C                    F
I saw her today at a reception
&nbsp; C                    F
A glass of wine in her hand
&nbsp; C                          F
I knew she would meet her connection
&nbsp;      C                      F
At her feet was her footloose man

No, you can't always get what you want

You can't always get what you want

You get what you need  ahhhhhhah yeah

## Verse

&nbsp; C                    F
And I went down to the demonstration
&nbsp; C                    F
To get my fair share of abuse
&nbsp; C                    F
Singing, "We're gonna vent our frustration
&nbsp; C                    F
If we don't we're gonna blow a 50-amp fuse"
&nbsp; C                    F
Sing it to me now...

## Chorus

You can't always get what you want
&nbsp;   C                         F
You can't always get what you want
&nbsp;          D                 F
And if you try sometime, you might find

You get what you need  ahhhhhhah yeah

## Verse

&nbsp; C                    F
I went down to the Chelsea drugstore
&nbsp; C                    F
To get your prescription filled
&nbsp; C                    F
I was standing in line with Mr. Jimmy
&nbsp; C                    F
And man, did he look pretty ill
&nbsp; C                    F
We decided that we would have a soda
&nbsp; C                    F
My favorite flavor, cherry red
&nbsp; C                    F
I sung my song to Mr. Jimmy
&nbsp; C                    F
Yeah, and he said one word to me, and that was "dead"
&nbsp; C                    F
I said to him

## Chorus

You get what you need  ahhhhhhah yeah
Oh yes! Woo!

## Verse

&nbsp; C                    F
I saw her today at the reception
&nbsp; C                    F
In her glass was a bleeding man
&nbsp; C                    F
She was practiced at the art of deception
&nbsp; C                    F
Well I could tell by her blood-stained hands

## Chorus

&nbsp;   C                         F
You can't always get what you want
&nbsp;   C                         F
You can't always get what you want
&nbsp;   C                         F

You get what you need  ahhhhhhah yeah
