G      D     F       G     C                   F    C
Here I stand head in hand, turn my face to the wall
G        D      F        G   C                F C D
If she's gone I can't go on, feeling two foot small
G    D     F      G     C              F  C
Everywhere people stare each and every way
G     D        F        G  C               F   C  D
I can see them laugh at me and I hear them say ay ay

## Chorus
G              C              Dsus D D6 D
Hey you got to hide your love away
Hey you got to hide your love away

G       D F    G    C           F   C
How can I even try, I can never win
G       D    F      G    C                F C D
Hearing them seeing them in the state I'm in
G         D   F      G  C              F    C
How could she say to me love will find away
G      D     F       G      C               F   C  D
Gather round all you clown, let me hear you say ay ay

## Chorus
G              C              Dsus D D6 D
Hey you got to hide your love away
Hey you got to hide your love away
