## Verse 1

```
Em
They made up their minds
                  Am
And they started packing
       B7                                    Em
They left before the sun came up that day
       E7                          Am
An exit to eternal summer slacking
Em                         B7
But where were they going without ever
                Em
Knowing the way?

Em
They drank up the wine
                Am
And they got to talking
B7                                    Em
They now had more important things to say
E7                                    Am
When the car broke down they started walking
Em                         B7
Where were they going without even
                Em      D
Knowing the way?
```

## Chorus 1

```
D                    G
Anyone can see the road that they walk on
         D
Is paved with gold
Em
It's always summer
              B7
They'll never get cold
              C
They'll never get hungry
              G             D
They'll never get old and grey
                   G                    D
You can see their shadows wandering off somewhere
         Em
They won't make it home
         B7
But they really don't care
         C
They wanted the highway
              G            D      B7
They're happier there today
```

## Verse 2

```
Em
Their children woke up
                    Am
And they couldn't find them
        B7                         Em
They left before the sun came up that day
        E7                                 Am
They just drove off and left it all behind'em
Em                        B7
But where were they going without ever
                Em      D
Knowing the way?
```

## Chorus 2

```
D                    G
Anyone can see the road that they walk on
         D
Is paved with gold
Em
It's always summer
              B7
They'll never get cold
              C
They'll never get hungry
              G             D
They'll never get old and grey
                   G                    D
You can see their shadows wandering off somewhere
         Em
They won't make it home
         B7
But they really don't care
         C
They wanted the highway
              G            D      B7
They're happier there today

D                    G

They'll never get cold

You can see their shadows wandering off somewhere
