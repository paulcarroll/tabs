## Verse

Em
They made up their minds
&nbsp;                 Am
And they started packing
&nbsp;      B7                                    Em
They left before the sun came up that day
&nbsp;      E7                          Am
An exit to eternal summer slacking
Em                         B7
But where were they going without ever
&nbsp;               Em
Knowing the way?

Em
They drank up the wine
&nbsp;               Am
And they got to talking
B7                                    Em
They now had more important things to say
E7                                    Am
When the car broke down they started walking
Em                         B7
Where were they going without even
&nbsp;               Em      D
Knowing the way?

## Chorus

D                    G
Anyone can see the road that they walk on
&nbsp;        D
Is paved with gold
Em
It's always summer
&nbsp;             B7
They'll never get cold
&nbsp;             C
They'll never get hungry
&nbsp;             G             D
They'll never get old and grey
&nbsp;                  G                    D
You can see their shadows wandering off somewhere
&nbsp;        Em
They won't make it home
&nbsp;        B7
But they really don't care
&nbsp;        C
They wanted the highway
&nbsp;             G            D      B7
They're happier there today

## Verse

Em
Their children woke up
&nbsp;                   Am
And they couldn't find them
&nbsp;       B7                         Em
They left before the sun came up that day
&nbsp;       E7                                 Am
They just drove off and left it all behind'em
Em                        B7
But where were they going without ever

&nbsp;               Em      D
Knowing the way?

## Chorus

D                    G
Anyone can see the road that they walk on
&nbsp;        D
Is paved with gold
Em
It's always summer
&nbsp;             B7
They'll never get cold
&nbsp;             C
They'll never get hungry
&nbsp;             G             D
They'll never get old and grey
&nbsp;                  G                    D
You can see their shadows wandering off somewhere
&nbsp;        Em
They won't make it home
&nbsp;        B7
But they really don't care
&nbsp;        C
They wanted the highway
&nbsp;             G            D      B7
They're happier there today

## Chorus

D                    G
Anyone can see the road that they walk on
&nbsp;        D
Is paved with gold
Em
It's always summer
&nbsp;             B7
They'll never get cold
&nbsp;             C
They'll never get hungry
&nbsp;             G             D
They'll never get old and grey
&nbsp;                  G                    D
You can see their shadows wandering off somewhere
&nbsp;        Em
They won't make it home
&nbsp;        B7
But they really don't care
&nbsp;        C
They wanted the highway

They're happier there today
