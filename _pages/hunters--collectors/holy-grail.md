&nbsp;    E             E                 C#m       B
Woke up this morning, from the strangest dream,
&nbsp;    E                     E         C#m            B
I was in the biggest army, the world had ever seen.
&nbsp;             E           E           C#m          B    E    A C#m B
We were marching as one, on the road, to the holy grail.

&nbsp;    E        E            C#m         B
Started out, seeking fortune and glory it's a,
&nbsp;    E      E                 C#m       B
Short song, but it's a, hell of a story,
&nbsp;              E                    E                 C#m           B    E    A C#m B
When you spend your lifetime trying to get your hands, on the holy grail...

## Chorus

&nbsp;    A                               C#m       B
Well have you heard about, the great crusade,
&nbsp;    A                          C#m        B
We ran into millions, but nobody got paid, yeah
&nbsp;    A                              C#m            B    E      A C#m B, E A C#m B
We raised four corners of the globe, for the holy grail...
&nbsp;    E                E                   C#m           B
All the locals scattered, they were hiding in the snow,
&nbsp;    E                    E        C#m            B
We were so far from home, so how were we to know,
&nbsp;                E               E                 C#m            B    E      A C#m B
There'd be nothing left to plunder, when we stumbled on the holy grail...

## Chorus

&nbsp;    A                                   C#m        B
We were full of beans, but we were dying like flies,
&nbsp;    A                                     C#m             B
And those big black birds, they were circling in the sky,
&nbsp;    A                              C#m    B            E       A C#m B  (E)
And you know what they say, yeah, nobody deserves to die...

## Bridge

&nbsp;    E            D                     C#m                     A        E
But I, I've been searching for an easy way, to escape the cold light of day,
&nbsp;               D                  C#m                    A       E
I've been high and I've been low, but I got nowhere else to go,
&nbsp;               D                  C#m                          A       E   D C#m C#m A
..........................................there's nowhere else to go...

## Chorus

&nbsp;    A                   C#m                  B
I followed orders, God knows where I've been,
&nbsp;    A                     C#m                B
But I woke up alone, all my wounds were clean,
&nbsp;    A               C#m            B            E       A   C#m B
I'm still here,   I'm still a fool for the holy grail...
