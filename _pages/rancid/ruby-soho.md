## Verse

C           D      G
&nbsp; Echoes of reggae coming
&nbsp;                  C
through my bedroom wall
C                D
&nbsp; Having a party up
&nbsp;             G
next door but i'm
&nbsp;                 C
sitting here all alone
C                   D
&nbsp; Two lovers in the bedroom
&nbsp;       G               C
and the other starts to shout
C                   G
&nbsp; All i got is this blank
&nbsp;     D
stare and that don't
carry no clout at all

## Verse
C             D    G
&nbsp; He's singing and she's
&nbsp;               C
there to lend a hand
C               D
&nbsp; He's seen his name on
&nbsp;               G
the marquee but she
&nbsp;               C
will never under-stand
C                 D
&nbsp; Once again he's leaving
&nbsp;   G
and she's there with
&nbsp;             C
a tear in her eye
C                 G
&nbsp; Embraces with a warm gesture
&nbsp;    D
it's time time to say goodbye

(Repeat Chorus 1)

## Verse
C                    D
&nbsp; Ruby's heart ain't beating
&nbsp;     G
cause she knows the
&nbsp;          C
feeling is gone
C               D
&nbsp; She's not the only
&nbsp;          G
one leaving there's
&nbsp;        C
something wrong
C
&nbsp; Little lover's
&nbsp;      D
in the distance
&nbsp;  G
as she wipes a
&nbsp;             C
tear from her eye
C               G
&nbsp; Ruby's fading out
she disappears
&nbsp;    D
it's time time
to say goodbye
