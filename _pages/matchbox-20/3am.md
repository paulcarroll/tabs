## Intro

```chordpro
G C, * G C, ^ G C, G C, G C, G C, * D
```

## Verse

&nbsp;       C            *     G         C, G C, * D
She said it is cold outside and she hands me my raincoat,
&nbsp;     C         *   G   C G C *D
She always worried about things like that.
&nbsp;    C                    *      G      C, G C, * D
She says it's all gonna end and it might as well be my fault.
&nbsp;          C
And she only sleeps while it's raining,
&nbsp;        D        C
And she screams, and her voice is straining...

## Chorus

&nbsp;    G   D C               G     D C
She says baby,  it's 3am I must be lonely,
&nbsp;     G  D C                       G      D     C
When she says baby,  well I can't help but be scared of it all sometimes
&nbsp;                                *     G C, G C, G C, G C * D
The rain's gonna wash away I believe it...

## Verse

&nbsp;        C                      *           G     C, G C, * D
She's got a little bit of something, god it's better than nothing,
&nbsp;        C                *         G  C, G C, * D
And in her colour portrait world she believes she's got it all.
&nbsp;     C                *       G     C, G C, * D
She swears the moon don't hang quite as high as it used to.
&nbsp;                             C
And she only sleeps when it's raining,
&nbsp;        D        C
And she screams, and her voice is straining...

## Chorus

&nbsp;    G   D C               G     D C
She says baby,  it's 3am I must be lonely,
&nbsp;     G  D C                       G      D     C
When she says baby,  well I can't help but be scared of it all sometimes
&nbsp;                                *        (C)
The rain's gonna wash away I believe it...

## Instrumental

```

## Verse

&nbsp;        C                   *               G     C, G C, * D
She believes that life is made up of all that you're used to,
&nbsp;                C                      *         G          C, G C, * D
And the clock on the wall has been stuck at three for days and days.
&nbsp;          C              *           G     C, G C <loud>
She thinks that happiness as mat that sits on her doorway.
&nbsp;   D                  C
But outside, it starts raining...

## Chorus

&nbsp;    G    D C            G      D C
She says baby,   it's 3am I must be lonely,
&nbsp;    G   D C               G       D    C
When she says baby, well I can't help but be scared of it all sometimes
&nbsp;   C                           G      D C                       G   D C
The rain's gonna wash away I believe it, yeah, it's 3am I must be lonely
&nbsp;     G  D C                       G   D    C.
When she says baby,  well I can't help but be scared of it all sometimes
