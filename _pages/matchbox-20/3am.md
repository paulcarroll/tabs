G C, * G C, ^ G C, G C, G C, G C, * D

 		   C			      *	   G         C, G C, * D
She said it is cold outside and she hands me my raincoat,
	     C			   *	 G   C G C *D
She always worried about things like that.
		  C			              *	    G      C, G C, * D
She says it's all gonna end and it might as well be my fault.
					 C
And she only sleeps while it's raining,
&nbsp;        D		 	 C
And she screams, and her voice is straining...

## Chorus
	   G	 D C	      	     G     D C
She says baby,  it�s 3am I must be lonely,
		  G	D C  					           G      D     C
When she says baby,  well I can�t help but be scared of it all sometimes
&nbsp;                                *     G C, G C, G C, G C * D
The rain's gonna wash away I believe it...

		      C			                *           G     C, G C, * D
She's got a little bit of something, god it�s better than nothing,
		      C			          *		     G  C, G C, * D
And in her colour portrait world she believes she's got it all.
		   C			          *		   G     C, G C, * D
She swears the moon don't hang quite as high as it used to.
&nbsp;                             C
And she only sleeps when it's raining,
&nbsp;        D		 	 C
And she screams, and her voice is straining...

## Chorus
	   G	 D C	      	     G     D C
She says baby,  it�s 3am I must be lonely,
		  G	D C  					           G      D     C
When she says baby,  well I can�t help but be scared of it all sometimes
&nbsp;                                *        (C)
The rain's gonna wash away I believe it...

## Instrumental
<quiet>  C, * C, * C, * C,
G C, G C, G C, G C, * D  (C)

	       C			             *               G     C, G C, * D
She believes that life is made up of all that you're used to,
	               C                      *         G          C, G C, * D
And the clock on the wall has been stuck at three for days and days.
	          C			        *           G     C, G C <loud>
She thinks that happiness as mat that sits on her doorway.
&nbsp;   D                  C
But outside, it starts raining...

## Chorus
	   G	  D C	      		G      D C
She says baby,   it�s 3am I must be lonely,
		  G	 D C  			       G       D    C
When she says baby, well I can�t help but be scared of it all sometimes
&nbsp;   C                           G      D C                       G   D C
The rain's gonna wash away I believe it, yeah, it�s 3am I must be lonely
		  G	D C  					           G   D    C.
When she says baby,  well I can�t help but be scared of it all sometimes
