## Intro

G G C9 Dsus4 G, G G C9 Dsus4 G

## Verse

&nbsp;    G                    C9           Dsus4
Another turning point a fork stuck in the road,
&nbsp;    G                            C9               Dsus4
Time grabs you by the wrist directs you where to go.
&nbsp;   Em            D          C9                G
So make the best of these test and don't ask why,
&nbsp;   Em       D          C9                G
It's not a question but a lesson learned in time,

## Chorus

&nbsp;     Em             G             Em              G
It's something unpredictable, but in the end it's right,
&nbsp; Em                D            G     G C9 Dsus4, G G C9 Dsus4
I hope you have the time of your life...

&nbsp;    G                        C9                   Dsus4
So take the photographs and still frames in your mind,
&nbsp;    G                       C9                   Dsus4
Hang it on a shelf, in good health and good time.
&nbsp;   Em           D        C9         G
Tatoos and memories and dead skin on trial,
&nbsp;   Em          D            C9            G
For what it's worth it was worth all the while,

## Chorus

&nbsp;     Em             G             Em              G
It's something unpredictable, but in the end it's right,
  Em                D            G     G C9 Dsus, G G C9 Dsus4
I hope you have the time of your life...

I hope you have the time of your life...
