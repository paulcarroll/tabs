 INTRO A G F# F E
A                G                  F# F E
&nbsp; I'm having trouble trying to sleep
A               G                   F# F E
&nbsp; I'm counting sheep but running out
A               G
&nbsp; As time ticks by
&nbsp; F#          F E
And still I try
A                G            F#
&nbsp; No rest for crosstops in my mind
F             E
On my own ... here we go
A G F# F E  X2
A                   G                      F# F E
&nbsp; My eyes feel like they're going to bleed
A                G            F#    F E
&nbsp; Dried up and bulging out my skull
A               G
&nbsp; My mouth is dry
F#           F    E
&nbsp; My face is numb
A                G             F#
&nbsp; Fucked up and spun out in my room
F             E
On my own ... here we go
A G F# F E X2
A               G           F# F E
&nbsp; My mind is set on overdrive
A               G             F#   F E
&nbsp; The clock is laughing in my face
A              G
&nbsp; Crooked spine
F#       F      E
&nbsp; Senses dulled
A                  G         F#
&nbsp; Passed the point of delirium
F             E
On my own ... here we go
A G F# F E X4
A                   G                      F# F E
&nbsp; My eyes feel like they're going to bleed
A                G            F#    F E
&nbsp; Dried up and bulging out my skull
A               G
&nbsp; My mouth is dry
F#           F    E
&nbsp; My face is numb
A                G             F#
&nbsp; Fucked up and spun out in my room
F             E
On my own ... here we go
