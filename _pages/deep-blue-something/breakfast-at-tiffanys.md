## Intro

D G A, D G A

## Verse

&nbsp;      D    G         A          D
You'll say, we've got nothing in common,
&nbsp;   G      A         D
No common ground to start from,
&nbsp;   G       A      D      G A
And we're falling apart...

&nbsp;      D        G         A       D
You'll say, the world has come between us,
&nbsp;   G          A       D
Our lives have come between us,
&nbsp;     G      A              D      G A
Still I know you just don't care...

## Chorus

&nbsp;   D                    A            G
And I said, what about, "Breakfast at Tiffany's?
&nbsp;       D              A          G
She said "I think I, remember the film,
&nbsp;      D                     A          G
And as I recall, I think, we both kinda liked it."
&nbsp;   D                        A               G
And I said "Well that's, the one thing we've got..."

## Instrumental

D G A, D G A

## Verse

&nbsp; D            G    A        D
I see you, the only one who knew me,
&nbsp;   G         A       D
And now your eyes see through me,
&nbsp;    G  A        D          G A
I guess I was wrong...
&nbsp;  D              G        A         D
So what now, it's plain to see we're over,
&nbsp;     G          A         D
And I hate when things are over,
&nbsp;    G          A      D      G A
When so much is left undone...

## Chorus

&nbsp;   D                    A            G
And I said, what about, "Breakfast at Tiffany's?
&nbsp;       D              A          G
She said "I think I, remember the film,
&nbsp;      D                     A          G
And as I recall, I think, we both kinda liked it."
&nbsp;   D                        A               G      (D)
And I said "Well that's, the one thing we've got..."

D                G         A          D
You'll say, that we've got nothing in common,
&nbsp;   G      A         D
No common ground to start from,
&nbsp;   G       A      D      G A
And we're falling apart...

D               G         A       D
You'll say, the world has come between us,
&nbsp;   G          A       D
Our lives have come between us,
&nbsp;     G      A              D      G A
Still I know you just don't care...
