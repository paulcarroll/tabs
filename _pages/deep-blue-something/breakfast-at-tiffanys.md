	D G A, D G A

	       D    G         A          D
	You'll say, we've got nothing in common,
	    G      A         D
	No common ground to start from,
	    G       A      D      G A
	And we're falling apart...

	       D        G         A       D
	You'll say, the world has come between us,
	    G          A       D
	Our lives have come between us,
	      G      A              D      G A
	Still I know you just don't care...

## Chorus

	    D                    A            G
	And I said, what about, "Breakfast at Tiffany's?
	        D              A          G
	She said "I think I, remember the film,
	       D                     A          G
	And as I recall, I think, we both kinda liked it."
	    D                        A               G
	And I said "Well that's, the one thing we've got..."

## Instrumental
	D G A, D G A

	  D            G    A        D
	I see you, the only one who knew me,
	    G         A       D
	And now your eyes see through me,
&nbsp;    G  A        D          G A
	I guess I was wrong...

	   D              G        A         D
	So what now, it's plain to see we're over,
	      G          A         D
	And I hate when things are over,
	     G          A      D      G A
	When so much is left undone...

## Chorus

	    D                    A            G

	And as I recall, I think, we both kinda liked it."
	    D                        A               G      (D)
	And I said "Well that's, the one thing we've got..."

	D                G         A          D
	You'll say, that we've got nothing in common,
	    G      A         D
	No common ground to start from,
	    G       A      D      G A
	And we're falling apart...

	D               G         A       D
	You'll say, the world has come between us,
	    G          A       D
	Our lives have come between us,

	Still I know you just don't care...
