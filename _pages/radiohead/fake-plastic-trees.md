## Verse 1

A                            F#m
Her green plastic watering can
                               D
For her fake chinese rubber plant
              A     D
In the fake plastic earth
A                               F#m
That she bought from a rubber man
                            D
In a town full of rubber plans
       A      D
To get rid of itself
             Bm
It wears her out..
             A
It wears her out..
             Bm
It wears her out..
             A
It wears her out

## Verse 2

A                         F#m
She lives with a broken man
                        D  
A cracked polystyrene man
          A           D  
Who just crumbles and burns
A                   F#m
He used to do surgery
                      D  
For girls in the eighties
            A      D
But gravity always wins
                 Bm 
And it wears him out..
             A
It wears him out..
             Bm
It wears him out..
      A
It weeeeeaaaars

## Verse 3

A                            F#m
She looks like the real thing
                           D
She tastes like the real thing
          A     D
My fake plastic love
A                         F#m
But I can't help the feeling
                             D
I could blow through the ceiling
           A        D
If I just turn and run
                Bm
And it wears me out
            A
It wears me out
            Bm
It wears me out
            A
It wears me out
               Bm
And if I could be who you wanted
           A
If I could be who you wanted
       Bm
All the time..
       A
All the time..
