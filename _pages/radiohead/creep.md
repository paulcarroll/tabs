## Verse
&nbsp;                    G                              B
When you were here before, couldn't look you in the eyes
&nbsp;                   C                         Cm
You're just like an angel, your skin makes me cry
&nbsp;                G                      B
You float like a feather in a beautiful world

I wish I was special, you're so fucking special

But I'm a creep, I'm a weirdo

What the hell am I doing here? I don't belong here

I don't care if it hurts, I wanna have control
&nbsp;                C                      Cm
I want a perfect body, I want a perfect soul
&nbsp;             G                    B
I want you to notice when I'm not around

You're so fucking special, I wish I was special

What the hell am I doing here? I don't belong here
