Bm                        F#
On a dark desert highway, cool wind in my hair
A                     E
Warm smell of colitas rising up through the air
G                         D
Up ahead in the distance, I saw a shimmering light
Em
My head grew heavy and my sight grew dim
F#
I had to stop for the night

Bm                               F#
There she stood in the doorway;  I heard the mission bell
A                                          E
And I was thinking to myself this could be heaven or this could be hell
G                        D
Then she lit up a candle, and she showed me the way
Em                                   F#
There were voices down the corridor, I thought I heard them say

## Chorus
G                        D
Welcome to the Hotel California.
&nbsp;     Em                   Bm7
Such a lovely place, such a lovely face
&nbsp; G                               D
Plenty of room at the Hotel California
&nbsp;     Em                                      F#
Any time of year (any time of year) you can find it here

Bm                               F#
Her mind is Tiffany twisted, she got the Mercedes bends
A                                          E
She got a lot of pretty, pretty boys that she calls friends
G                        D
How they dance in the courtyard, sweet summer sweat
Em                                   F#
Some dance to remember, some dance to forget

Bm                               F#
So I called up the captain;  "Please bring me my wine."
A                                          E
"We haven't had that spirit here since nineteen sixty-nine"
G                        D
And still those voices are calling from far away
Em                                   F#
Wake you up in the middle of the night, just to hear them say

## Chorus
G                        D
Welcome to the Hotel California.
&nbsp;     Em                   Bm7
Such a lovely place, such a lovely face
&nbsp; G                               D
They livin' it up at the Hotel California
&nbsp;     Em                                      F#
What a nice surprise (what a nice surprise) bring your alibis

Bm                               F#
Mirrors on the ceiling, the pink champagne on ice
A                                          E
And she said "We are all just prisoners here, of our own device"
G                        D
And in the master's chambers, they gathered for the feast
Em                                   F#
They stab it with their steely knives, but they just can't kill the beast

Bm                               F#
Last thing I remember, I was running for the door
A                                          E
I had to find the passage back to the place I was before
G                        D
"Relax" said the nightman, "We are programmed to receive"
Em                                   F#
"You can check out anytime you like, but you can never leave"

(Instrumental and fade)
