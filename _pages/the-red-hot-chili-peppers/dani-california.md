## Verse

Am                   G
 Getting born in the state of Mississippi,
&nbsp;   Dm                         Am
Her Poppa was a copper and her Momma was a hippie
Am          G
 In Alabama she would swing a hammer,
Dm                           Am
Price you gotta pay when you break the panorama
Am         G                   Dm       Am
 She never knew that there was anything more than poor,
Am           G               Dm      Am
 What in the world does your company take me for?

## Verse

Am             G
Black bandana, sweet Louisiana,
Dm                       Am
Robbin' on a bank in the state of Indiana,
Am               G
 She's a runner, rebel and a stunner,
Dm                        Am
On her merry way sayin', "baby whatcha gonna"
Am                 G           Dm         Am
&nbsp; Lookin' down the barrel of a hot metal .45,
Am             G          Dm
&nbsp; Just another way to survive

Shoulda seen it coming when it got a little brighter,
Am                 G
 With a name like "Dani California",
Dm                      Am
Day was gonna come when I was gonna mourn ya,
Am        G               Dm        Am

## Bridge

Bm            G     D           F#
 Who knew the other side of you?
Bm             G      D             F#
 Who knew what others died to prove?
Bm           G       D         F#
 Too true to say goodbye to you
Bm
 Too true, too sad, sad, sad

## Verse

Am               G
 Push the fader, gifted animator,
Dm                   Am
One for the now and eleven for the later,
Am             G
 Never made it up to Minnesota,
Dm                     Am
North Dakota man was a gunnin' for the quota
Am           G                Dm         Am
 Down in the Badlands she was saving the best for last,
Am       G            | Dm       | E7
 It only hurts when I laugh;  gone too fast
