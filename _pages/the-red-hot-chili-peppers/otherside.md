## Chorus

Am                  F           C
How long how long will I slide
&nbsp;  G          Am F    C
Separate my side I don't
&nbsp;    G                 Am   F
I don't believe it's bad
&nbsp;  C                    G
Slit my throat, it's all I ever

## Verse

Am                                  Em
I heard your voice through a photograph
Am                        Em
I thought it up it brought up the past
Am                           Em
Once you know you can never go back
&nbsp;              G             Am
I've got to take it on the otherside

## Verse

Am                                  Em
Centuries are what it meant to me
Am                                  Em
A cemetery where I marry the sea
Am                                  Em
Stranger things could never change my mind
&nbsp;              G             Am
I've got to take it on the otherside
G                     Am
Take it on the otherside
&nbsp;  G           Am
Take it on, take it on

Am                  F           C

Separate my side I don't
&nbsp;    G                 Am   F
I don't believe it's bad
&nbsp;  C                    G
Slit my throat, it's all I ever

## Verse

Am                                  Em
Pour my life into a paper cup
Am                                  Em
The ashtray's full and I'm spilling my guts
Am                                  Em
She wants to know am I still a slut
G                     Am
I've got to take it on the otherside

## Verse

Am                                  Em
Scarlet starlet and she's in my bed
Am                                  Em
A candidate for my soul mate bled
Am                                  Em
Push the trigger and pull the thread
G                     Am
I've got to take it on the otherside
G                     Am
Take it on the otherside
G                     Am
Take it on, take it on

&nbsp;  G          Am F    C
Separate my side I don't
&nbsp;    G                 Am   F
I don't believe it's bad
&nbsp;  C                    G
Slit my throat, it's all I ever
