Bm
There must be something
In the way I feel
&nbsp;    A         G          Bm  A G
That she don't want me to feel
&nbsp;   Bm
The stare she bares cut me
A       G
I don't care
&nbsp;                    Bm   A G
You see so what if I bleed

&nbsp; B
I could never change
&nbsp;    D
Just what I feel
&nbsp;  Aadd9
My face will never show
G
What is not real

## Interlude

## Verse
&nbsp; Bm
A mountain never seems to have
The need to speak
&nbsp; A         G              Bm  A G
A look that shares so many seek
&nbsp;   Bm
The sweetest feeling

I got from you
&nbsp;   A         G                Bm  A G
The things I said to you were true

&nbsp; B
I could never change
&nbsp;    D
Just what I feel
&nbsp;  Aadd9
My face will never show
G
What is not real

Bm A G

&nbsp; Em                  G
I could have lied I'm such a fool
&nbsp;  D                      C
My eyes could never never never
Keep their cool
Em               G
Showed her and I told her now
&nbsp;   D                 C
She struck me but I'm fucked up now

Bm A G x6

## Verse
&nbsp;   Bm
But now she's gone yes she's gone away
&nbsp; A       G
A soulful song
&nbsp;              Bm  A G
That would not stay
&nbsp;   Bm
You see she hides 'cause she is scared
&nbsp;   A       G
But I don't care
&nbsp;          Bm    A G
I won't be spared

&nbsp; Em                  G
I could have lied I'm such a fool

My eyes could never never never
Keep their cool
Em               G
Showed her and I told her now
&nbsp;   D                 C
She struck me but I'm fucked up now

I could have lied I'm such a fool

My eyes could never never never
Keep their cool

Showed her and I told her now

She struck me but I'm fucked up now
