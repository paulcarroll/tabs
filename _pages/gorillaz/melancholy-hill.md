## Verse

```
C
Up on melancholy hill
                    G
There's a plastic tree
                  Am
Are you here with me?
     F                  G
Just looking out on the day
           F     G
Of another dream
```

## Verse

```
      C
Well, you can't get what you want
                 G
But you can get me
                    Am
So let's head out to sea
       F              G
'Cause you are my medicine
                     F   G
When you're close to me
                     C
When you're close to me
```

## Verse

```
   C
So call in the submarine
                       G
'Round the world we'll go
              Am
Does anybody know?
         F                  G
If we're looking out on the day
           F     G
Of another dream
```

## Hook

```
C   G   Am
 
   F                      G
If you can't get what you want
                   F   G
Then you come with me
```

## Chorus

```
C                       G
Up on melancholy hill
           Am
Sits a manatee
     F                    G
Just looking out for the day
                     F   G
When you're close to me
                     C
When you're close to me
```
