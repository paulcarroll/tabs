## Verse

Fmaj7               G/C
&nbsp;   Now here you go again
&nbsp;           Fmaj7         G/C
You say you want your freedom
Fmaj7       G/C
Well who am I to keep you down
Its only right that you should
Play the way you feel it
But listen carefully to the sound
Of your loneliness
Like a heartbeat.. drives you mad
In the stillness of remembering what you had
And what you lost...
And what you had...
And what you lost

## Chorus

Am           G/C                  Fmaj7
Thunder only happens when its raining
Am         G/C                 Fmaj7
Players only love you when theyre playing
&nbsp;      Am                 G/C              Fmaj7
Say... women... they will come and they will go
Am                 G/C            Fmaj7
When the rain washes you clean you'll know... you'll know

## Solo

## Verse

(Fmaj7 & G/C repeated)

Now here I go again, I see the crystal visions
I keep my visions to myself
Its only me
Who wants to wrap around your dreams and...
Have you any dreams youd like to sell?
Dreams of loneliness...
Like a heartbeat... drives you mad...
In the stillness of remembering what you had...
And what you lost...
And what you had...
And what you lost

## Chorus

Am           G/C                  Fmaj7
Thunder only happens when its raining
Am         G/C                 Fmaj7
Players only love you when theyre playing
&nbsp;      Am                 G/C              Fmaj7
Say... women... they will come and they will go
Am               G/C                  Fmaj7
When the rain washes you clean you'll know... you'll know
