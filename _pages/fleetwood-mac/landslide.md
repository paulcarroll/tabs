I took my love, I took it down

Climbed a mountain and I turned around
&nbsp;     C        G/B             Am7          G/B
And I saw my reflection in the snow-covered hills

Till the landslide brought me down

Can the child within my heart rise above?
&nbsp;     C                G/B      Am7   G/B
Can I sail through the changin' ocean tides?
&nbsp;     C          G/B           Am7 G/B  C   Am7  G/B
Can I handle the seasons of my li -  i - fe?

Built my life around you
