## Intro

*Riff (A)*

A E D A
We'll do it all, everything, on our own.
A E D A
We don't need, anything, or anyone...
*<strum>*  A E
If I lay here, if I just lay here,
D A 
Would you lie with me and, just forget the world.
*<pick>*  A E D A
I don't quite know, how to say, how I feel,
A E D A  
Those three words, I said too much, but not enough...
*<strum>*  A E
If I lay here, if I just lay here,
 D A 
Would you lie with me and, just forget the world.  
A E
Forget what we're told, before we get too old,
 D A
Show me a garden that's, bursting into life...
*<quiet>*  A E D A  
Let's waste time, chasing cars, around our heads
A E D A.  
I need your grace, to re-mind me, to find my own.
*<loud>*  A E
If I lay here, if I just lay here,
 D A
Would you lie with me and, just forget the world.  
A E
Forget what we're told, before we get too old,
 D A
Show me a garden that's, bursting into life.
 A E
All that I am, all that I ever was,
 D A 
Is here in your perfect eyes, they're all I can see.  
A E
I don't know where, confused about how as well,
 D A 
 Just know that these things will never, change for us at all...

## Outro

*<quiet>* A E
If I lay here, if I just lay here,
 D A A
Would you lie with me and, just forget the world.
