## Verse

G#m      F#       C#      G#m    F#  C#
Bury me softly in this womb
G#m          F#       C#      G#m   F#  C#
I give this part of me for you
G#m                  F#      C#
Sand rains down and here I sit
G#m           F#
Holding rare flowers
C#     G#m      F#  C#    G#m F# C#
In a tomb
G#m                   F#             C#        G#m    F#  C#
Down in a hole and I don't know if I can be saved
G#m                  F#       C#      G#m     F#  C#
See my heart, I decorate it like a grave
G#m
You don't understand who they
F#             C#           G#m     F#  C#
Thought I was supposed to be
G#m                         F#
Look at me now, I'm a man
C#                     G#m   F#  C#
Who won't let himself be

## Chorus

C#m             B F#     C#m              B  F#
Down in a hole,        losin' my soul
C#m             B F#     C#m              B  F#
Down in a hole,        losin' control
C#m     B     G#m    B    F#
I'd   like   to    fly
E                         G#m      F#  C#  G#m   F#  C#
But my wings have been so denied

## Verse

G#m                         F#
Down in a hole and they've put all
    C#               G#m      F#   C#
The stones in their place
G#m                       F#
I've eaten the sun so my tongue
         C#             G#m     F#   C#
Has been burned of the taste
G#m
I have been guilty
   F#           C#         G#m     F#   C#
Of kicking myself in the teeth
G#m              F#
I will speak no more
      C#       G#m        F#   C#
Of my feelings beneath

## Chorus

C#m             B  F#    C#m              B  F#
Down in a hole,        losin' my soul
C#m             B  F#    C#m              B  F#
Down in a hole,        losin' control
C#m     B      G#m     B    F#
I'd    like   to     fly
E                         G#m      F# C#   G#m   F#  C#
But my wings have been so denied

## Verse

G#m      F#      C#       G#m
Bury me softly in this womb
G#m            F#    C#       G#m
Oh, I want to be inside of you
G#m          F#       C#      G#m
I give this part of me for you
G#m            F#    C#       G#m
Oh, I want to be inside of you
G#m                   F#   C#
Sand rains down and here I sit
G#m           F#
Holding rare flowers
C#    G#m
In a tomb
G#m            F#     C#
Oh, I want to be inside...

## Chorus

C#m             B  F#    C#m              B  F#
Down in a hole,        losin' my soul
C#m             B  F#    C#m                B  F#
Down in a hole,        feelin' so small
C#m             B  F#    C#m              B  F#
Down in a hole,        losin' my soul
C#m             B  F#    C#m             B  F#
Down in a hole,        outta control
C#m     B      G#m      B    F#
I'd    like   to      fly
    E                       G#m     F#  C#
But my wings have been so denied
