## Verse

Em
There’s a shadow just behind me,
G
shrouding every step I take,
D
making every promise empty,
F
pointing every finger at me.

Em
Waiting like a stalking butler
G
who upon the finger rests.
D
Murder now the path called “must we"
F
just because the son has come.

Em
Jesus, won’t you fucking whistle
G
something but the past and done?
D
Jesus, won’t you fucking whistle
F
something but the past and done?

[Hook]

Em
Why can’t we not be sober?
G
I just want to start things over.
D
Why can’t we drink forever.
F
I just want to start this over.

## Verse

Em
I am just a worthless liar.
G
I am just an imbecile.
D
I will only complicate you.
F
Trust in me and fall as well.

Em
I will find a center in you.
G
I will chew it up and leave,
D
I will work to elevate you
F
just enough to bring you down.

Em
Mother Mary won’t you whisper
G
something but what’s past and done.
D
Mother Mary won’t you whisper
F
something but what’s past and done.

[Hook]

Em
Why can’t we not be sober?
G
I just want to start things over.
D
Why can’t we sleep forever.
F
I just want to start this over.
