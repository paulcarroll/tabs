## Intro

```
(Guitar 1)
E  /  E7  /   (repeat)

(Guitar 2)
                Riff A
```

## Verse

E               E
There’s a shadow just behind me,
D7#5            D7#5
shrouding every step I take,
E               E
making every promise empty,
D7#5            D7#5
pointing every finger at me.

E               E
Waiting like a stalking butler
D7#5            D7#5
who upon the finger rests.
E               E
Murder now the path called “must we"
D7#5            D7#5
just because the son has come.

E               E
Jesus, won’t you fucking whistle
D7#5            D7#5
something but the past and done?
E               E
Jesus, won’t you fucking whistle
D7#5            D7#5
something but the past and done?

## Chorus

D             F
Why can’t we not be sober?
  D             F
I just want to start things over.
D              F
Why can’t we drink forever.
D               F
I just want to start this over.

*[Riff A]*

## Verse

E               E
I am just a worthless liar.
D7#5            D7#5
I am just an imbecile.
E               E
I will only complicate you.
D7#5            D7#5
Trust in me and fall as well.

E               E
I will find a center in you.
D7#5            D7#5
I will chew it up and leave,
E               E
I will work to elevate you
D7#5            D7#5
just enough to bring you down.

E               E
Mother Mary won’t you whisper
D7#5            D7#5
something but what’s past and done.
E               E
Mother Mary won’t you whisper
D7#5            D7#5
something but what’s past and done.

## Chorus

D             F
Why can’t we not be sober?
  D             F
I just want to start things over.
D              F
Why can’t we drink forever.
D               F
I just want to start this over.
