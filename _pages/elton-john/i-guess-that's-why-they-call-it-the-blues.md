## Verse

&nbsp;             G
Don't wish it away
&nbsp;     Em              F        C    F C F C F
Don't look at it like it's for-ever
&nbsp; C             G
Between you and me
&nbsp;                Bm                  F        C      F C F C F
I could honestly say that things can only get better
&nbsp;   C         G         B7               Em    G7
And while I'm away bust out the demons inside
&nbsp;               C                     G
And it won't be long before you and me run
&nbsp;       Am          F               G    Am7    G7
To the place in our hearts where we hide

## Chorus

&nbsp;     C                     G           F
And I guess that's why they call it the blues
&nbsp;          C               G              F
Time on my hands could be time spent with you
C             G
Laughing like children
&nbsp;           Am
Living like lovers
C            F                   D
Rolling like thunder, under the covers
&nbsp;     F                      G          C      Em F
And I guess that's why they call it the blues

## Verse

&nbsp;               G
Just stare into space
Em          F           C F C F C F
Picture my face in your hands
C                G
Live for each second
&nbsp;           Bm               F            C  F C F C F
Without hesitation, never forget I'm your man
C          G     B7                     Em     G7
Wait on me girl, cry in the night if it helps
&nbsp;   C            G               Am
But more than ever I simply love you
&nbsp;           F           G     Am7    G7
More than I love life itself

## Chorus

&nbsp;     C                     G           F
And I guess that's why they call it the blues
&nbsp;          C               G              F
Time on my hands could be time spent with you
C             G
Laughing like children
&nbsp;           Am
Living like lovers
C            F                   D
Rolling like thunder, under the covers
&nbsp;     F                      G           C      Em F
And I guess that's why they call it the blues

## Outro

&nbsp;     F                     G          C
And I guess that's why they call it the blues
