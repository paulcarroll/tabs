## Verse

Em7                                |  A  |  A     Asus4 |
 She packed my bags last night pre-flight
Em7              |  A  |  A     G/B |
 Zero hour, nine A.M.
C                 G/B  Am  C/G             |  D/F#    Dsus2 |  D    |
 And I'm gonna be hi-i-igh ... as a kite by then
Em7                          A         Asus4
 I miss the earth so much, I miss my wife
Em7                   |  Asus4      G/B |
&nbsp;  It's lonely out in space
C          G/B  Am        C/G   | D/F# D/A | D    C/D |
 On such a ti-i-imeless flight

## Chorus

G                                      [ C ]
 And I think it's gonna be a long long time
C                                       [ G ]
 Til touchdown brings me 'round again to find
G                                  [ C ]
 I'm not the man they think I am at home
C           G/B       A          Asus4 A
 Oh no, no, no, I'm a rocket man
C                                  | G         Gsus4 G |  C  |
Rocket man, burnin' out his fuse up here alone
G                                      [ C ]
 And I think it's gonna be a long long time
C                                       [ G ]
 Til touchdown brings me 'round again to find
G                                  [ C ]
 I'm not the man they think I am at home
C           G/B       A          Asus4 4
 Oh no, no, no, I'm a rocket man
C                                  | G         Gsus4 G |  C  Cadd9 |
Rocket man, burnin' out his fuse up here alone

## Verse
Em7                            A               Asus2
 Mars ain't the kinda place to raise your kids
Em7                    |  A  |  A     G/B |
&nbsp; In fact it's cold as hell
C                   G/B      Am             C/G          | D/F# D/A | D |
 And there's no one there to-o-o raise them ... if you did
Em7                            A
 And all this science, I don't understand
Em7                         |  A     A7sus4 |
 It's just my job five days a week
&nbsp;        C  G/B Am  C/G         | D/F# D/A | D    C/D |
A rocket ma-a-a-an,    rocket man

## Chorus
G                                      [ C ]
 And I think it's gonna be a long long time
C                                       [ G ]
 Til touchdown brings me 'round again to find
G                                  [ C ]
 I'm not the man they think I am at home
C           G/B       A          Asus4 A
 Oh no, no, no, I'm a rocket man
C                                  | G         Gsus4 G |  C  |
Rocket man, burnin' out his fuse up here alone
G                                      [ C ]
 And I think it's gonna be a long long time
C                                       [ G ]
 Til touchdown brings me 'round again to find
G                                  [ C ]
 I'm not the man they think I am at home
C           G/B       A          Asus4
 Oh no, no, no, I'm a rocket man
C                                  | G         Gsus4 G |
Rocket man, burnin' out his fuse up here alone

&nbsp;  And I think it's gonna be a long long time
