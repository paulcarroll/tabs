Intro 
A , Dsus2


A    
Woke up cold one tuesday,
Cadd9                 G
i'm looking tired and feeling quite sick, 
A                                             Cadd9      E       
i felt like there was something missing in my day to day life, 
     A
so i quickly opened the wardrobe, 
Cadd9                       G
pulled out some jeans and a T-Shirt that seemed clean, 
A
topped it off with a pair of old shoes, 
          Cadd9             E      
that were ripped around the seams,
              Dsus2 
and I thought these shoes just don't suit me. 

{start_of_chorus}
A               E
Hey, I put some new shoes on, 
    Dsus2
and suddenly everything is right,
        A               E                 
I said, hey, I put some new shoes on 
    Dsus2
and everybody's smiling, it’s so inviting, 
    A                   E
Oh, short on money, but long on time,
Dsus2 
slowly strolling in the sweet sunshine,
    A 
and i'm running late,
           E 
and i dont need an excuse,
           Dsus2 
'cause i'm wearing my brand new shoes.
 

A
Woke up late one thursday,
Cadd9                   G
i'm seeing stars as i'm rubbing my eyes, 
      A
and i felt like there were two days missing, 
     Cadd9          E
as i focused on the time,
      A 
and i made my way to the kitchen,
Cadd9                      G 
but i had to stop from the shock of what i found,
A                             Cadd9             E 
a room full of all my friends dancing round and round,
              Dsus2 
and i thought hello new shoes, bye bye blues. 

{start_of_chorus}
A               E
Hey, I put some new shoes on, 
    Dsus2
and suddenly everything is right,
        A               E                 
I said, hey, I put some new shoes on 
    Dsus2
and everybody's smiling, it’s so inviting, 
    A                   E
Oh, short on money, but long on time,
Dsus2 
slowly strolling in the sweet sunshine,
    A 
and i'm running late,
           E 
and i don’t need an excuse,
           Dsus2 
'cause i'm wearing my brand new shoes. 

{start_of_bridge}
A                                        Cadd9
Take me wandering through these streets, 
A                                    Cadd9
where bright lights and angels meet, 
A                               Cadd9
stone to stone they take me on,  
   Dsus2
I’m walking to the break of dawn. (x2) 

{start_of_chorus} (x2)
A               E
Hey, I put some new shoes on, 
    Dsus2
and suddenly everything is right,
        A               E                 
I said, hey, I put some new shoes on 
    Dsus2
