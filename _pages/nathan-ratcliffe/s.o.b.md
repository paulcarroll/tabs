## Intro

F
(Mmmm hmm, mmmm hmm, mmmm hmm hmm hmm) x2

## Verse

I'm gonna need someone to help me
I'm gonna need somebodyâ€™s hand
I'm gonna need someone to hold me down
I'm gonna need someone to care
I'm gonna writhe and shake my body
I'll start pulling out my hair
I'm going to cover myself with the ashes of you and nobody's gonna give a damn

## Chorus

&nbsp;             F
Son of a bitch
&nbsp;               Bb
Give me a drink
&nbsp;              C
One more night
Bb                  C
&nbsp;  This can't be me
&nbsp;              F
Son of a bitch
&nbsp;                    Bb
If I can't get clean

I'm gonna drink my life away

(Whoa oh, whoa oh, whoa oh oh oh) x2
Now for seventeen years I've been throwing them back
Seventeen more will bury me
Can somebody please just tie me down?
Or somebody give me a goddamn drink

I'm gonna drink my life away

## Verse

F
(Mmmm hmm, mmmm hmm, mmmm hmm hmm hmm) x2
My heart was breaking, hands are shaking, bugs are crawling all over me.
My heart was breaking, hands are shaking, bugs are crawling all over me.
My heart was breaking, hands are shaking, bugs are crawling all over me.
My heart was breaking, hands are shaking, bugs are crawling all over me.
