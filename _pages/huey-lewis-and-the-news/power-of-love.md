## Intro

C  C/E   F  G   C  C/E   F    G
Cm7      F      Cm7      F Bb F

## Verse

&nbsp;   Cm7      Bb        Cm7
The power of love is a curious thing
               Bb           Cm7
make a one man weep, make another man sing
         Bb        Cm7
Change a hawk to a little white dove
            Bb      Cm7
more than a feeling    that's the power of love
| F  Gm7 |
 
Tougher than diamonds, bricks like cream
Stronger and harder than a bad girl's dream
make a bad one good make a wrong one right
power of love that keeps you home at night

## Chorus

C               C/E    F           G
 You don't need money,  don't take fame
C              C/E            F         G
 Don't need no credit card to ride this train
     C               C/E               F          G
It's strong and it's sudden and it's cruel sometimes
       Bb         F         Gsus4
but it might just save your life
G                     Cm7
 That's the power of love
F                     Cm7
 That's the power of love
F Bb F

## Verse

First time you feel it, it might make you sad
Next time you feel it it might make you mad
But you'll be glad baby when you've found
that's the power makes the world go'round

## Chorus

And it don't take money,  don't take fame
don't need no credit card to ride this train
It's strong and it's sudden it can be cruel sometimes
but it might just save your life

## Bridge

Eb              G7               Cm7
  They say that all in love is fair
          Cm7/F     F
yeah, but you don't care
Ab             Eb/G
  But you know what to do
Fm7             Eb
   when it gets hold of you
Ab                 Gsus4
  and with a little help from above
G                       Cm7
 you feel the power of love
F                       Cm7
 you feel the power of love
F
 Can you feel it ?
Cm7     F Cm7 Bb
   Hmmm

## Chorus

It don't take money and it don't take fame
don't need no credit card to ride this train
Tougher than diamonds and stronger than steel
C          C/E         F            G
 you won't feel nothin' till you feel
C               C/E F           Gsus4
 you feel the power, just the power of love
C             C/E F             Gsus4      C
 That's the power, that's the power of love
F             G
 You feel the power of love
C F             G            C
   you feel the power of love
F         G            C  C/E F  Gsus4
 feel the power of love
 
C  C/E F  Gsus4    (to fade)
