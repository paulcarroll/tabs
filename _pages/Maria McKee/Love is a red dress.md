A    D  A    D  A    G   A   Asus2
     

A  D        A     D A
My heart is empty
E             A    D
Your eyes are dull
A    D       A      D A
Once we were hungry
G   D          A     A7
    Now we are full 
             
{start_of_chorus}
D               A        D A
These ties that bind us
B7                 D  Dsus4 D Dsus2
  Can't beat these chaaaaaains
A  D       A       D A
If love is shelter
G           D           A    
  I'm gonna walk in the rain
D   A   D   A   G   A  Asus2
   

A  D        A     D A
You were my angel
E             A    D
Now you are real
A    D       A      D A
So like a stranger
G           D           A    
Colder than steel

{start_of_chorus}
D           A     D A
The morning after
B7              D  Dsus4  D  Dsus2
  No one should braaaaaaaaaaaaag
A  D             A     Asus2
If love is a red dress
G      D          A
  Well hang me in rags
D   A   D   A   G   A   A7
   
{start_of_bridge}
D          A
Ooooooooh  well
E              Esus4 A    A7
There goes the fairy tale
D     Dsus4      A
Lord, ain't it a shame
D           A
In all this comfort
  G              A
I can't take the strain
D   A   D   A   G   A  Asus2
   

A  D         A     D A
If we played even
E     Esus4  A     D Dsus4 D
I'd be your queen
A   D           A        D A
But someone was cheatin'
G     D         A   A7
  and it wasn't me
   
{start_of_chorus}
D               A      D A
I played on the table
B7                   D  Dsus4 D  Dsus2
  You held something baaaaaaaack
A  D       A    Asus2
If love is aces
G  D           A
   Give me the jack
D   A   D   A   G   A
