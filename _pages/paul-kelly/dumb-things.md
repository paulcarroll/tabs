## Intro

```
Am Em, Am Em, Am Em, Am C G D,
Am Em, Am Em, Am Em, Am C G D,
```

## Verse

&nbsp;   Am        Em       Am       Em
Welcome strangers, to the show,
&nbsp;   Am        Em      Am     C  G  D   Am
I'm the one who should be ly-ing low.
&nbsp;             Em        Am          Em
Saw the knives out, turned my back,
&nbsp;   Am          Em          Am       C     G  D
Heard the train coming, stayed right on that track...

## Chorus
F             C             Em                   F    G
In the middle, in the middle, in the middle of a dream.
&nbsp; Am      Em       F         C
I lost my shirt, I pawned my rings,
G         D       Am         Em, Am Em, Am Em, Am C G D
I've done all the dumb things...

## Verse

&nbsp;   Am           Em   Am          Em
Caught the fever, heard the tune,
&nbsp;   Am          Em       Am        C     G  D   Am
Thought I loved her, hung my heart on the moon.
&nbsp;       Em     Am     Em
Started howling, made no sense,
&nbsp;   Am        Em               Am   C  G    D
Thought my friends would rush to my defense...

## Chorus
F             C             Em                   F    G
In the middle, in the middle, in the middle of a dream.
&nbsp; Am      Em       F         C
I lost my shirt, I pawned my rings,
G         D       Am         Em, Am Em, Am Em, Am C G D
  I've done all the dumb things...

## Instrumental

```
F C Em F G, Am Em F C G D
Am Em, Am Em, Am Em, Am C G D (Am)
```

## Verse

&nbsp;   Am      Em      Am          Em
And I get all your good advice,
&nbsp;   Am      Em            Am    C       G     D      Am
Never stops me from going through these things twice.
&nbsp;           Em            Am          Em
I see the knives out, I turn my back,
&nbsp;   Am           Em            Am       C     G  D        (F)
I hear the train coming, I stayed right on that track...

## Chorus

F             C             Em                   F    G
In the middle, in the middle, in the middle of a dream.
&nbsp; Am      Em       F         C
I lost my shirt, I pawned my rings,
G         D       Am         Em
  I've done all the dumb things...

## Outro

&nbsp; Am     Em     F      C  G         D    Am       Em
I melted wax to fix my wings, I've done all the dumb things,
&nbsp; Am       Em    F      C   G         D    Am         Em
I threw my hat into the ring, I've done all the dumb things,
Am             Em     F      C     G         D        Am         Em
I thought that I just had to sing, I've done all the dumb things...

Instrumental:  Am Em, Am Em, Am C G D, Am.
