## Intro

G D C G, G D C G

## Verse

G                 D    C             G
They got married early, never had no money,
G                D        C                    G
Then when he got laid off, they really hit the skids,
G                 D        C                  G
He started up his drinking, then they started fighting,
G                 D     C                  G
He took it pretty badly, she took both the kids,
G         Em               D      C                D
She said: I'm not standing by, to watch you slowly die,
            C       D        G    D        C    G        G    D        C    G
So watch me walking, out the door, out the door, out the door, out the door.

## Verse

G               D         C             G
She went to her brother's, got a little bar work,
G              D       C               G
He went to the buttery, stayed about a year,
G               D      C               G
Then he wrote a letter, said I want to see you,
G                      D     C                     G
She thought he sounded better, she sent him up the fare.

## Chorus

G   Em        D     C             D
He was riding through the cane, in the pouring rain,
  C    D   G    D       C    G       G    D       C    G
On Olympic, to her door, to her door, to her door, to her door...

## Instrumental

G D C G, G D C G, G D C G, G D C G  *<quiet>*

## Verse

G               D     C              G
He came in on a Sunday, every muscle aching,
G               D     C                     G
Walking in slow motion, like he'd just been hit,
G               D     C                   G
Did they have a future? Would he know his children?
G               D      C                     G   *<loud>*
Could he make a picture, and get them all to fit?

## Chorus

G   Em        D     C               D
He was shaking in his seat, riding through the streets,
      C         D
In a silvertop, to her,
Em           D     C                  D
Shaking in his seat, riding through the streets,
      C         D       G    D       C    G       G    D       C    G
In a silvertop, to her door, to her door, to her door, to her door...
