## Intro
Am   Fmaj7   C   G
&nbsp;                Hey!
Am   Fmaj7   C   G
&nbsp;                Hey!
Am   Fmaj7   C   G
&nbsp;                Hey!
Am   Fmaj7   C   G

## Verse
Am           Fmaj7                  C
I don't like walking around this old and empty house
&nbsp;  Am                 F                C
So hold my hand, I'll walk with you my dear
&nbsp;   Am           Fmaj7              C
The stairs creak as you sleep, it's keeping me awake
&nbsp;        Am            F                 C
It's the house telling you to close your eyes
&nbsp;   Am        Fmaj7       C
And some days I can't even dress myself
&nbsp;    Am            F               C
It's killing me to see you this way

## Chorus
&nbsp;                 Am        Fmaj7
'Cause though the truth may vary, this
C           G
&nbsp; ship will carry our
Am     F            C
bodies safe to shore

## Interlude
Am   Fmaj7   C   G
&nbsp;                Hey!
Am   Fmaj7   C   G
&nbsp;                Hey!
Am   Fmaj7   C   G
&nbsp;                Hey!
Am   Fmaj7   C   G

## Verse
&nbsp;          Am        Fmaj7            C
There's an old voice in my head that's holding me back
&nbsp;     Am              Fmaj7            C
Well, tell her that I miss our little talks
Am              Fmaj7    C
Soon it will be over and buried with our past
&nbsp;  Am              Fmaj7             C
We used to play outside when we were young (and full of life and full of love)
Am        Fmaj7           C
Some days I don't know if I am wrong or right
&nbsp;    Am              Fmaj7             C
Your mind is playing tricks on you my dear

## Chorus
&nbsp;                 Am        Fmaj7
'Cause though the truth may vary, this
C            G
&nbsp; ship will carry our
Am     Fmaj7        C
bodies safe to shore   Hey!
&nbsp;     Am          Fmaj7  C    G
Don't listen to a word I say. Hey!
&nbsp;   Am          Fmaj7     C     G
The screams all sound the same. Hey!
&nbsp;          Am        Fmaj7
Though the truth may vary, this
C           G
&nbsp; ship will carry our
Am     Fmaj7        C  G
bodies safe to shore

## Verse
&nbsp;      Am
You're gone, gone, gone away. I watched you disappear
Am
All that's left is a ghost of you
&nbsp;         Am
Now we're torn, torn, torn apart, there's nothing we can do
&nbsp;    Am
Just let me go, we'll meet again soon
&nbsp;   Am          Fmaj7       C
Now wait, wait, wait for me. Please hang around

I'll see you when I fall asleep. Hey!

The screams all sound the same. Hey!
&nbsp;          Am        Fmaj7
Though the truth may vary, this
C           G
&nbsp; ship will carry our
Am     Fmaj7        C  G
bodies safe to shore

&nbsp;     Am          Fmaj7  C    G
Don't listen to a word I say. Hey!
&nbsp;   Am          Fmaj7     C     G
The screams all sound the same. Hey!
&nbsp;          Am        Fmaj7
Though the truth may vary, this
C           G
&nbsp; ship will carry our
Am     Fmaj7        C  G
bodies safe to shore

[Ending]
