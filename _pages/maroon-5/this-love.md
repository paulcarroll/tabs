## Verse

G7                      Adim
I was so high I didn't recognize
&nbsp;         Fm7                                  G7
the fire burning in her eyes, the chaos that controlled my mind...
G7                            Adim
whispered goodbye as she got on a plane
Fm7
Never to return again
&nbsp;                G7
But always in my heart

## Chorus

She said goodbye too many times before

And her heart is breaking in front of me

I have no choice cause I won't say goodbye anymore

## Verse

G7                           Adim
I tried my best to feed her appetite
&nbsp;               Fm7
Keep her coming every night
&nbsp;                   G7
So hard to keep her satisfied
G                             Adim
Kept playing love like it was just a game
&nbsp;             Fm7
Pretending to feel the same
&nbsp;                    G7
Then turn around and leave again  (oh!)

I have no choice cause I won't say goodbye anymore

Repair your broken wings

My pressure on her hips

Sinking my fingertips
