&nbsp; D D D

&nbsp;      D
Well I don't know why I came here tonight,
&nbsp;         D
I got the feeling that something ain't right.
&nbsp;       G7
I'm so scared in case I fall off my chair,
&nbsp;       D
And I'm wondering how I'll get down the stairs.

## Chorus

&nbsp; A                         C            G
Clowns to the left of me, jokers to the right,
&nbsp;      D
Here I am stuck in the middle with you,
&nbsp;       D
Yes I'm, stuck in the middle with you...

&nbsp;        D
And I'm wondering what it is I should do,
&nbsp;       G7
It's so hard to keep this smile from my face.
&nbsp;       D
Losing control yeah I'm all over the place,
&nbsp; A                         C            G
Clowns to the left of me, jokers to the right,
&nbsp;      D
Here I am stuck in the middle with you...

## Bridge

&nbsp;        G
Well you started out with nothing,
&nbsp;                                            D
And you're proud that you're a self-made-man,
&nbsp;            G
And your friend they all come crawlin',
&nbsp;                            D       A7      D D D
Slap you on the back and say please, please...

&nbsp; D
Trying to make some sense of it all,
&nbsp;         D
But I can see that it makes no sense at all.
&nbsp;     G7
Is it cool to go to sleep on the floor,
&nbsp;        D
'Cause I don't think that I can take anymore.

## Chorus

&nbsp; A                         C            G
Clowns to the left of me, jokers to the right,
&nbsp;      D                                  (D)
Here I am stuck in the middle with you...

And your friend they all come crawlin',
