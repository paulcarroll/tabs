## Verse

D
This thing(This Thing) called love (Called Love)
&nbsp;  G                        C          G
It cries (Like a baby) In a cradle all night
&nbsp;  D
It swings (Woo Woo) It jives (Woo Woo)
&nbsp;  G                      C     G
It shakes all over like a jelly fish,

I kinda like it
Bb           C            D
Crazy little thing called love

There goes my baby, she knows how to rock and roll.
&nbsp;             Bb                  E             A
She drives me crazy, she gives me hot and cold fever,
&nbsp;        F
then she leaves me in a cool,cool sweat

## Verse

I gotta be cool relax, get hip
Get on my track's
Take a back seat, hitch-hike
And take a long ride on my motor bike
Until I'm ready (Ready Freddie)
Crazy little thing called love

This thing called love I just can't handle it
this thing called love I must get round to it
I ain't ready
Crazy little thing called love
Crazy little thing called love
Crazy little thing called love
Crazy little thing called love
Crazy little thing called love
Crazy little thing called love
Crazy little thing called love
Crazy little thing called love
