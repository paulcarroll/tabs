## Intro
E

## Verse
&nbsp;                             E
She never mentions the word "addiction"

In certain company
&nbsp;                             E
Yes, she'll tell you she's an orphan

After you meet her family

## Interlude
| B   | A   | E   | E   | x2

## Verse
&nbsp;                                E
She paints her eyes as black as night now

Pulls those shades down tight
&nbsp;                                  E
Yeah, she gives a smile when the pain come

The pain gonna make everything alright

## Chorus
&nbsp;                 B       A
Says she talks to angels
&nbsp;                 E
They call her out by her name
&nbsp;                     B        A
Oh yeah, she talks to angels
&nbsp;                      E
Says they call her out by her name

## Verse
&nbsp;                                E
She keeps a lock of hair in her pocket

She wears a cross around her neck
&nbsp;                        E
Yes, the hair is from a little boy

And the cross is someone she has not met

Not yet

## Chorus
&nbsp;                 B       A
Says she talks to angels
&nbsp;                 E
They call her out by her name
&nbsp;                     B        A
Oh yeah, she talks to angels
&nbsp;                      E
Says they call her out by her name

## Bridge
A                  E
She don't know no lover
A                 E
None that I ever seen
A                        E
Yeah, to her that ain't nothin'
&nbsp;       A
But to me, it means
&nbsp;        E
Means everything

## Verse
&nbsp;                                E
She paints her eyes as black as night now

Pulls those shades down tight
&nbsp;                                  E
Yeah, she gives a smile when the pain come

The pain gonna make everything alright

They call her out by her name

Call her out by her name?
