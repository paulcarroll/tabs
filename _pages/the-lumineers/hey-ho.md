Intro is C and F/C (with the F chord only on the last down beat)

## Verse
C                               F/C C
I've been trying to do it right
C                               F/C C
I've been living the lonely life
C                               F/C C
I've been sleeping here instead
C                               F/C Am
I've been sleeping in my bed
Am                   G      F/C C    F/C C
I've been sleeping in my bed

## Verse
C                                   F/C C
So show me family
C                                   F/C C
And all the blood that I will bleed
C                                   F/C C
I don't know where I belong
C                                       Am
I don't know where I went wrong
Am               G     F/C   C
But I can write a song.

## Chorus
&nbsp;             Am                  G                   C
I belong with you, you belong with me, you're my sweetheart
&nbsp;             Am                  G              F/C  C
I belong with you, you belong with me, you're my sweet

## Verse
C                                 F/C C
I don't think you're right for him
C                                 F/C C
Think of what it might've been if you
C                                 F/C C
Took a bus to Chinatown
C                           Am     G     F/C C
I'd be standing on Canal...    and Bowery
Am                       G      F/C  C
And she'd be standing next to me

## Chorus
&nbsp;             Am                  G                   C
I belong with you, you belong with me, you're my sweetheart
&nbsp;             Am                  G                   C
I belong with you, you belong with me, you're my sweetheart

## Bridge
&nbsp;     F/C C    G         C
And love, we need it now
&nbsp;      F/C C        Gsus
Let's hope for some

Cuz oh, we're bleeding out
