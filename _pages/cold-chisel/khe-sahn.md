## Verse

&nbsp; Em                   C                  G   C G
I left my heart to the sappers round, Khe Sahn,
&nbsp;      Em                    C                   D
And my soul was sold with my cigarettes, to the, black market man.
&nbsp;            Em           C                G                   C
I've had the Vietnam cold turkey, from the ocean to the silver city,
&nbsp;               Am         F               D    Dsus D D
And it's only other vets could understand...

## Verse

&nbsp;           Em             C              G   C G
'Bout the long forgotten dockside guarantees,
&nbsp;              Em                 C                D
How there were no V-day heroes in nineteen seventy-three.
&nbsp;      Em                 C               G                         C
How we sailed into Sydney Harbour, saw an old friend but I couldn't kiss her.
&nbsp;              Am               D                 G     C G D
She was lined, and I was home to the lucky land...

## Verse

&nbsp;       Em           C                   G C G
She was like so many more from that time on,
&nbsp;     Em                C                  D
Their lives were all so empty, till they'd found there chosen one.
&nbsp;         Em              C               G                 C
And their legs were often open, but their minds were always closed,
&nbsp;         Am                  F             D     Dsus D D
&nbsp;  And their hearts were held in fast suburban chains...

## Verse

&nbsp;        Em              C             G    C G
And the legal pads were yellow, hours long pay packets lean,
&nbsp;       Em            C                    D
And the telex writers clattered, where the gunships once had been.
&nbsp;       Em                C            G                 C
But the car parks made me jumpy, and I never stopped the dreams,
&nbsp;      Am               D             G      C G D
&nbsp;   Or the growing need for speed and novocaine...

## Verse

&nbsp;     Em                C                   G  C G
So I worked across the country from end to end,
&nbsp;        Em              C                     D
Tried to find a place to settle down, where my mixed up life could mend.
&nbsp;      Em        C               G               C
Held a job on an oil-rig, flying choppers when I could,
&nbsp;       Am               F                  D   Dsus D D (Em)
&nbsp;   But the nightlife nearly drove me round the bend...

## Verse

&nbsp;        Em                  C                  G   C G
And I've travelled round the world from year to year,
&nbsp;   Em                C                 D
And each one found me aimless, one more year the worse for wear.
&nbsp;        Em                      C             G                 C
And I've been back to South East Asia, and the answer sure ain't there,
&nbsp;       Am                 D                 G     C G D
&nbsp;   But I'm drifting north, to check things out again...

## Verse

&nbsp;            Em            C               G   C G
Well the last plane of Sydney's almost gone,
&nbsp;        Em                              C               D
And only seven flying hours, and I'll be landing in Hong Kong.
&nbsp;               Em               C              G             C
And there ain't nothin' like the kisses, from a jaded Chinese princess,
&nbsp;         Am                 F                  D   Dsus D D
&nbsp;   I'm gonna hit some Hong Kong mattress all night long...

## Verse

&nbsp;          Em                C               G   C G
Well the last plane out of Sydney's almost gone,
&nbsp;            Em                C               D
You know the last plane out of Sydney's almost gone.
&nbsp;        Em            C                  G                    C
And it's really got me worried, I'm going nowhere and I'm in a hurry.
&nbsp;            Am                D               G     C G D
&nbsp;   You know the last plane out of Sydney's almost gone...

## Verse

&nbsp;          Em                C               G   C G
Well the last plane out of Sydney's almost gone, (yeah yeah)
&nbsp;            Em                C               D
You know the last plane out of Sydney's almost gone. (oooh)
&nbsp;        Em            C                  G                    C
And it's really got me worried, I'm going nowhere and I'm in a hurry.
&nbsp;            Am                D                      G   C G C, G.
&nbsp;  You know the last plane out of Sydney's  a l m o s t  g o n e.
