## Intro

&nbsp; A E, A E,

## Verse

&nbsp;    A                                        E
The kids are driving and Saturday afternoon just passed me by,
&nbsp;    A                      E
I'm just savouring familiar sights.
&nbsp;    A                       E
We shared some history, this town and I,
&nbsp;    A             B                G#m               A
And I can't stop that long-forgotten feeling of her,
&nbsp;    A                   B              E
In time to book a room and stay tonight...

## Verse

&nbsp;    A                                     E
Number 1 is to find some friends and say, you're doing well,
&nbsp;    A                                  E
After all this time you boys look just the same.
&nbsp;    A                              E
Number 2 is the Happy Hour at one of two hotels,
&nbsp;    A                   B            G#m          A
And settle in to play do you remember so-and-so,
&nbsp;    A            B             E
Number 3 is never say her name...

## Chorus

&nbsp;           A              B             F#m
And oh the flame trees'll blind a weary driver,
&nbsp;           A                 B                E
And there's nothing that can set fire to this town.
&nbsp;           A                 B         C#m                E
There's no change, there's no pace, everything within its place,
&nbsp;           A          B                    E
Just makes it harder to believe that she won't be around...

## Verse

&nbsp;    A                               E
Oh, who needs that sentimental bullshit anyway,
&nbsp;    A                                     E
It takes more than just a memory, to make me cry.
&nbsp;    A                                     E
And I'm happy just to sit here, at a table with old friends,
&nbsp;    A                                                  E
And see which one of us can tell the biggest lies,
&nbsp;                   A                                           E
And there's a girl, she's fallin' in love, near where the pianola stands,
&nbsp;    A                                             E
With a young local factory auto worker, just holdin' hands,
&nbsp;             A                  G#m              B   (C)
And I'm wondering if he'll go or if he'll stay,

## Refrain

&nbsp;    C          G              C                 G            D     E
Do you remember, nothing stopped us on the field in our day...

## Chorus

&nbsp;           A              B             F#m
And oh the flame trees'll blind a weary driver,
&nbsp;           A                 B                E
And there's nothing that can set fire to this town.
&nbsp;           A                 B         C#m                E
There's no change, there's no pace, everything within its place,
&nbsp;           A          B                    E
Just makes it harder to believe that she won't be around...
