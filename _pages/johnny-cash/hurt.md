Main Riff x2

w/Main Riff:
Am     C (�)    Dsus2 (�)   Am       C (�)   Dsus2 (�)
&nbsp;     I hurt myself today          to see if     I still feel
Am    C (�)    Dsus2 (�)     Am         C (�)  Dsus2 (�)
&nbsp;     I focus    on the pain         the only thing that's real
Am         C (�)    Dsus2 (�)   Am         C (�)   Dsus2 (�)
&nbsp;     The needle tears a hole         the old familiar sting
Am            C (�)   Dsus2 (�)  Am            C (�)       Dsus2 (�)
&nbsp;     Try to kill it all away            but I remember everything

## Chorus
G   Am7                      Fadd9  C                        G
&nbsp;   What have I become?             My sweetest friend
Am7              Fadd9        C             G
Everyone I know   goes away in the end
&nbsp;      Am7                   Fadd9   G (2)
And you could have it all        My empire of dirt
Am7              Fadd9        G
I will let you down            I will make you hurt

w/Main Riff:
Am     C (�)      Dsus2 (�)   Am    C (�)   Dsus2 (�)
&nbsp;   I wear this crown of thorns   upon my liar's chair
Am    C (�)    Dsus2 (�)    Am        C (�)   Dsus2 (�)
&nbsp;      Full of broken thoughts   I cannot repair
Am      C (�)         Dsus2 (�) Am          C (�)     Dsus2 (�)
&nbsp;   Beneath the stains of time       the feelings disappear
Am     C (�)     Dsus2 (�)   Am   C (�)  Dsus2 (�)
&nbsp;        You are someone else       I am still right here

## Chorus 2:
G   Am7              Fadd9    C                       G
&nbsp;   What have I become?       My sweetest friend
Am7              Fadd9                 C             G
Everyone I know           goes away in the end
&nbsp;      Am7              Fadd9  G (2)
And you could have it all   My empire of dirt
Am7              Fadd9        G (2)
I will let you down            I will make you hurt

Am7                  Fadd9         G (2)
If I could start again         A million miles away
Am7              Fadd9      G (hold)
I would keep myself        I would find a way
Am     C (�)      Dsus2 (�)   Am
