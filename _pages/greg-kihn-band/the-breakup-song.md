[1st VERSE:]

&nbsp;        Am                         F
&nbsp; We had broken up for good just an hour before
&nbsp;       G              Am
&nbsp; Uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh
&nbsp;         Am                                F
&nbsp; Now I'm staring at the bodies as they're dancing 'cross the floor
&nbsp;       G              Am
&nbsp; Uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh
&nbsp;              Am                             F
&nbsp; And then the band slowed the tempo when the music took you down
&nbsp;       G              Am
&nbsp; Uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh
&nbsp;            Am                     F
&nbsp; It was the same old song with the melancholy sound
&nbsp;       G              Am     G
&nbsp; Uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh

## Chorus

&nbsp; F  F             C  C                   G  G      Dm  Dm
&nbsp;       They don't write 'em like that anymore
&nbsp; F  F                  C  C                   G      Gsus4    G
&nbsp;       They just don't write 'em like that anymore

[2nd VERSE:]

&nbsp; We been living together for a million years
&nbsp; Uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh
&nbsp; But now it feels so strange out in the atmospheres
&nbsp; Uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh
&nbsp; And then the jukebox plays a song I used to know
&nbsp; Uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh
&nbsp; And now I'm staring at the bodies as they're dancing so slow
&nbsp; Uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh

## Chorus

&nbsp; F  F             C  C                   G  G      Dm  Dm
&nbsp;       They don't write 'em like that anymore
&nbsp; F  F             C  C                   G      Gsus4    G
&nbsp;       They don't write 'em like that anymore

(Repeat Intro)

[3rd VERSE:]

&nbsp; Now I wind up staring at an empty glass
&nbsp; Uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh
&nbsp; Cause it's so easy to say that you'll forget your past
&nbsp; Uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh

(Repeat Chorus-1 3x and fade)
