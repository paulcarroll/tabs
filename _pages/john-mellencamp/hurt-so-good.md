## Verse

A             E        F#m                   D
 When I was a young boy, said put away those young boy ways,
A                     E                  F#m                D
 Now that I'm gettin' older so much older, I love all those young boy days.
A                     E A                 E
 With a girl like you,   with a girl like you,
F#m                        D                E
 Lord knows there are things we can do baby, just me and you,
E
 Come on and make it...

A                E          F#m                     D
 You always look so invitin', you ain't as green as you are  young.
