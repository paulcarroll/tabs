&nbsp;  C                                               Am
&nbsp;  Post office clerks put up signs saying position closed,
&nbsp;      C                                                 Am
&nbsp;  And secretaries turn off typewriters and put on their coats.
&nbsp;      F                    C            G                   F
&nbsp;  And janitors padlock the gates, for security guards to patrol.
&nbsp;      F                         C
&nbsp;  And bachelors phone up their friends for a drink,
&nbsp;            G                      F         F
&nbsp;  While the married ones turn on a chat show,
&nbsp;              C               F                  C
&nbsp;  And they'll all be lonely tonight and lonely tomorrow...

&nbsp;  Gentlemen time please you know we can't serve anymore,
&nbsp;          C                                                      Am
&nbsp;  Now the traffic lights change to stop, when thereï¿½s nothing to go.
&nbsp;         F                         C         G                    F
&nbsp;  And by five o'clock everything's dead, and every third car is a cab,
&nbsp;      F               C
&nbsp;  And ignorant people sleep in their beds,
&nbsp;           G                       F
&nbsp;  Like the doped white mice in the college lab...

## Chorus
&nbsp;      C            F       C                   F
&nbsp;  And nothing ever happens, nothing happens at all.
&nbsp;      Am                    F
&nbsp;  The needle returns to the start of the song,
&nbsp;         G                   F
&nbsp;  And we all sing along like before.
&nbsp;            C               F                  C
&nbsp;  And we'll all be lonely tonight and lonely tomorrow...

&nbsp;  C                                              Am
&nbsp;  Telephone exchanges click while there's nobody there,
&nbsp;  C                                                   Am
&nbsp;  The Martians could land in the carpark and no one would care.
F                        C                           G                F
&nbsp;  Close-circuit cameras in department stores shoot the same movie every day,
&nbsp;      F                            C
&nbsp;  And the stars of these films neither die nor get killed,
&nbsp;   G                       F       F (C)
&nbsp;  Just survive constant action replay...

## Chorus
&nbsp;      C            F       C                   F
&nbsp;  And nothing ever happens, nothing happens at all.

&nbsp;         G                   F
&nbsp;  And we all sing along like before.
&nbsp;            C               F                  C        C
&nbsp;  And we'll all be lonely tonight and lonely tomorrow...
