## Verse

C                                               Am
Post office clerks put up signs saying position closed,
&nbsp;   C                                                 Am
And secretaries turn off typewriters and put on their coats.
&nbsp;   F                    C            G                   F
And janitors padlock the gates, for security guards to patrol.
&nbsp;   F                         C
And bachelors phone up their friends for a drink,
&nbsp;         G                      F         F
While the married ones turn on a chat show,
&nbsp;           C               F                  C
And they'll all be lonely tonight and lonely tomorrow...

Gentlemen time please you know we can't serve anymore,

Now the traffic lights change to stop, when there's nothing to go.
&nbsp;      F                         C         G                    F
And by five o'clock everything's dead, and every third car is a cab,
&nbsp;   F               C
And ignorant people sleep in their beds,
&nbsp;        G                       F
Like the doped white mice in the college lab...

## Chorus

&nbsp;   C            F       C                   F
And nothing ever happens, nothing happens at all.
&nbsp;   Am                    F
The needle returns to the start of the song,
&nbsp;      G                   F
And we all sing along like before.
&nbsp;         C               F                  C
And we'll all be lonely tonight and lonely tomorrow...

C                                                   Am
The Martians could land in the carpark and no one would care.
F                        C                           G                F
Close-circuit cameras in department stores shoot the same movie every day,
&nbsp;   F                            C
And the stars of these films neither die nor get killed,
 G                       F       F (C)
Just survive constant action replay...

## Chorus

&nbsp;   C            F       C                   F
And nothing ever happens, nothing happens at all.
&nbsp;   Am                    F
The needle returns to the start of the song,
&nbsp;      G                   F
And we all sing along like before.

And we'll all be lonely tonight and lonely tomorrow...

And we'll all be lonely tonight and lonely tomorrow.
