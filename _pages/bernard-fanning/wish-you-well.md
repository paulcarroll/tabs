Bm G(½) A D G(½) A   x2

Bm          G    A     D     G   A
Up so early feel so bright
Bm           G    A        D     G   A
Didn't get much sleep last night
Em                    D/F#    G      A
Freight train rattled through my head
D               G    A      D     G  A
Whistle blowing love is dead
D         G   A    D     G   A
Is dead

Bm                G    A   D     G   A
Heart attacked by fear and doubt
Bm            G        A     D         G   A
won't be long till the truth comes out
Em                D/F#   G    A
first impressions never lie
D                  G    A     D       G   A
Lover's bonds they hold so fast

| D / G A | D / G A |

Em                      G
Restless future burning bright
A                         Bm
The past is holding on so tight
D                       Em
Never heard the warning bell
D                  G    A   D     G   A
And I just want to wish you well
D              G    A   D      G   A
I just want to wish you well

Bm               G   A   D      G  A
Welcome swallows dip and swing
Bm                      G    A    D      G  A
Take their cue from the slightest thing
Em          D/F#    G     A
Rolling fog into my room
D           G       A        D        G    A
Why did you give up on me so soon?
D      G   A
So soon
