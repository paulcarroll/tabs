BRING ME SOME WATER - MELISSA ETHERIDGE
Intro: A, A, A, A
 A A
Tonight I feel so weak, but all in love is fair.
 A (NC)
I turn the other cheek, and I feel the slap, and the sting of the foul night air.  Ds9 A
And I know, you're only human, and I haven't got talking room,
 Ds9 E
But tonight while I'm making excuses, some other woman, is making love to you...

## Chorus
A G D Dsus D A G D Dsus D
Somebody bring me some water, can't you see I'm burning alive,
A G D A G D
Can't you see my baby's got another lover, I don't know how, I'm gonna survive.
A G D Dsus D A G D Dsus D
Somebody bring me some water, can't you see it's out of control.
A G D
Baby's got my heart, and my baby's got my mind,
 E E (NC) A A

 A A
Will this aching pass, will this night be through,
 A
I want to hear the breaking glass, I only feel the steel of the red hot truth.  Ds9 A
And I'd do anything to get it out of my mind, I need some insanity, of that temporary kind, Ds9 E
Tell me how will I, ever be the same, when I know that woman is whispering your name...
