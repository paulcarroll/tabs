## Verse

Bm      D         G                   A
&nbsp;       Has our conscience shown?
Bm      D         G                   A
&nbsp;       Has the sweet breeze blown?
Bm      D         G                   A
&nbsp;       Has all the kindness gone?
Bm      D         G
&nbsp;       Hope still lingers on.
A
&nbsp;       I drink myself of newfound pity
A
&nbsp;       Sitting alone in New York City.
&nbsp;                G
&nbsp;       And I don't know why.

## Verse

Bm      D      G                A
Bm      D      G                A
Bm      D      G                A
&nbsp;       Are we listening?
Bm      D      G                A
&nbsp;       Hymns of offering
Bm      D      G                A
&nbsp;       Have we eyes to see
Bm      D      G
&nbsp;       That love is gathering?
A
&nbsp;       All the words that I've been reading
A
&nbsp;       Have now started the act of bleeding
&nbsp;    G
&nbsp;       Into one....Into one.

## Chorus

D                         A
&nbsp;       So I walk upon high
&nbsp;                            G
&nbsp;       And I step to the edge
&nbsp;                            D
&nbsp;       To see my world below.
D                            A
&nbsp;       And I laugh at myself
&nbsp;                              C
&nbsp;       While the tears roll down.
&nbsp;                                  G
&nbsp;       'Cause it's the world I know.
&nbsp;                                Bm
&nbsp;       Oh It's the world I know.

A
&nbsp;       All the words that I've been reading
A
&nbsp;       Have now started the act of bleeding
&nbsp;    G
&nbsp;       Into one....Into one.

## Chorus

D                         A
&nbsp;       So I walk upon high
&nbsp;                            G
&nbsp;       And I step to the edge
&nbsp;                            D
&nbsp;       To see my world below.
D                            A
&nbsp;       And I laugh at myself
&nbsp;                              C
&nbsp;       While the tears roll down.
&nbsp;                                  G
&nbsp;       'Cause it's the world I know.
&nbsp;                                Bm
&nbsp;       Oh It's the world I know.

D         A                   G                   A
