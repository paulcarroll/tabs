D         G              C9     G
I seem to recognize your face
D          G                  C9      G
Haunting familiar yet I can't seem to place it
Cannot find the candle of thought to light your name
Lifetimes are catching up with me

C9        G              C9
All these changes taking place
G                 C9
Wish I'd seen the place
&nbsp;   G             C9    G
But no one's ever taken me

D          C9            G    C9   G
Hearts and thoughts they fade fade away
Hearts and thoughts they fade fade away

D         G              C9      G
I swear I recognize your breath
Memories like fingerprints are slowly raising
Me you wouldn't recall for I'm not my former
It's hard when your stuck upon a shelf

C9          G               C9
I change by not changing at all
&nbsp;     G                C9
Small town predicts my fate
&nbsp;  G                       C9       G
Perhaps that's what no one wants to see

D      C9      G         C9    G
I just want to scream hello
D  C9       G                  C9            G
My god it's been so long never dreamed you'd return
But now here you are and here I am
Hearts and thoughts they fade away

D          C9            G    C9   G
Hearts and thoughts they fade fade away
Hearts and thoughts they fade fade away
Hearts and thoughts they fade fade away
Hearts and thoughts they fade fade away
Hearts and thoughts they fade fade away
Hearts and thoughts they fade fade away
