## Verse

A            G
     At home    drawing pictures
            G
Of mountain tops
A
With him on top
          A
Lemon yellow sun
G
Arms raised in a V
G            A
And the dead lay in pools of maroon below
A     G                          G
    Daddy didn't give attention
A                                 A     G
Oh, to the fact that mommy didn't care
                    G      A
King Jeremy The Wicked
A
Ruled his world

## Chorus

F              Dm E     A
Jeremy spoke in class today
F              Dm E     A
Jeremy spoke in class today

## Verse

A   G
      Clearly I remember
                G    A
Pickin' on the boy      Seemed a harmless little fuck
A   G
      But we unleashed a lion
G  A
Gnashed his teeth and bit the recess lady's breast
               A     G
How could I forget
                                   G
And he hit me with a surprise left
A
My jaw left hurting
                 A
Dropped wide open
G
Just like the day
    A
Oh, like the day I heard
A   G                             G
   Daddy didn't give affection, no!
A                                             A    G
And the boy was something that mommy wouldn't wear
                  G      A
King Jeremy The Wicked
A
Ruled his world

## Chorus

F              Dm E     A
Jeremy spoke in class today
F              Dm E     A
Jeremy spoke in class today
F              Dm E     A
Jeremy spoke in class today
F              Dm E     A
Jeremy spoke in class today
