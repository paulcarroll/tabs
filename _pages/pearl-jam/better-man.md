## Verse

&nbsp;    D/F#                              E7/F#
Waiting, watching the clock it's four o'clock, it's got to stop,
&nbsp;    D/F#                        E7/F#
Tell him, take no more she practices her speech as he
F6/A            G/B
Opens the door, she rolls over,
F6/A                    G/B
Pretends to sleep as he looks her over...

Can't find a better man, can't find a better man,   ohh...

## Verse

Talking to herself, there's no one else who needs to know,
D/F#                 E7/G# <loud>
She tells herself, oh,
D/F#                       E7/G#
Memories back when she was bold and strong and waiting for the
F6/A     G/B         F6/A                        G/B
World to come along, swears she knew him now she swears he's gone...
