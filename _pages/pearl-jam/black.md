# Verse

E          A          Asus4 A
Sheets of empty canvas
&nbsp;    E          A       A  Asus4 A
untouched sheets of clay
E                   A
her lace spread out before me
&nbsp;    E
as her body once did

E          A       Asus4 A
All five horizons,
&nbsp;   E               A                       Asus4 A
revolved around her soul as the earth to the sun
E                  A
now the air I tasted and breathed,
&nbsp;   E
has taken a turn
&nbsp;     C                                Em
oooh all I know I taught her was.. everything
&nbsp;     C                                Em
oooh all I she gave me all.. that she wore
&nbsp;       D
and my bitter hands
&nbsp;        C
shake beneath the clouds
&nbsp;                 Em
of what was everything
&nbsp;       D                         C
all the pictures have all been washed in black
&nbsp;               Em
tatooed everything
E       A          Asus4 A
I take a walk outside
&nbsp;      E          A              Asus4 A
I'm surrounded by some kids at play
E             A
I can feel their laughter
&nbsp;  E
so what can I say
&nbsp;  C                                            Em
ooh all my twisted thoughts they spin round my head im spinnin
&nbsp;  C                                            Em
oooh i'm spinnin how quick the sun can drop awayayayay
&nbsp;     D
and my bitter hands
&nbsp;  C
cradle broken glass
&nbsp;              Em
of what was everything
&nbsp;     D                   C
all my pictures have all been washed in black
Em
tatooed everything
&nbsp;     D
all my love gone bad
&nbsp;       C
turned my world to black
&nbsp;         D
tatooed all I see
&nbsp;       C
all that I am
&nbsp;                Em
all that I'll beeeeeeee   yeaahheah

&nbsp; D
I know some day you'll have a beautiful life
&nbsp; C
I know you'll be a sun,
&nbsp;   Em             D                  C
in sombody elses sky, whyhy, whyhy  whyhy
&nbsp;                               Em
cant it be in, cant it be miiiiiiine.
