## Intro

C Dm F

## Verse

C               Dm              F       C
Found a note of words this very morning
               Dm                   F       C
Written on the best paper you could find
                    Dm        F      C
You left it on your favourite table
        Dm              F
And I expected your goodbye
C              Dm                   F
It said (like) something about separation
C               Dm             F
It said for the two of us only good
C            Dm                F
It said like fly in our own direction
    C          Dm               F
And spread our souls across the world

## Chorus

C       Dm        F
Sweet Marie I'm a live
C       Dm        F
Sweet Marie I'm a live
C       Dm        F
Sweet Marie I'm a live

## Verse

C                   Dm                  F
Last night I went a walking down by the lakeside
C                  Dm                         F
It was a hot balmy night and three ducks flew by
C                       Dm       F
I came to a tree I said hi can I sit here
C             Dm           F
And listen to the crickets lullabye
                      C             Dm
And I will make you a basket (Sweet Marie..)
                       F
From the rushes by the lakes
                      C                     Dm
Put your memories and thoughts in it (Sweet Marie..)
                         F
Take as long as it might take ooooh

I hope the colours of the rainbow

And I know you'll find love
