## Verse

E                                                   F#m
What a night for a dance, you know I'm a dancing machine
&nbsp;      G#m                                             F#m
With a fire in my bones and the sweet taste of kerosene
E                                                   F#m
I get lost in the night so high I don't want to come down
G#m                                             F#m
To face the loss of the good thing that I've found
E         F#m    G#m    F#m
oohooh oooooh oohohoh oooooooh

## Verse

E                                                   F#m
In the dark of the night I could hear you calling my name
G#m                                             F#m
With the hardest of hearts I still feel full of pain
E                                                   F#m
So I drink and I smoke and I ask you if you're ever around
&nbsp;     G#m                                             F#m
Even though it was me who drove us right in the ground

## Chorus

&nbsp;         A
See the time we shared it was precious to me
&nbsp;                          B           E
But all the while I was dreaming of revelry

*(chords only)*
E  F#m G#m  F#m

## Verse

E                                                   F#m
Born to run, baby run like a stream down a mountainside
G#m                                             F#m
With the wind in my back I don't ever even bat an eye
E                                                   F#m
Just know it was you all along who had a hold of my heart
G#m                                             F#m
But the demon and me were the best of friends from the start

## Chorus

&nbsp;       A
So the time we shared it was precious to me
&nbsp;           B           E
All the while I was dreaming of revelry

*(chords only)*
E  F#m G#m  F#m

F#m             E
Dreaming of revelry

*(chords only)*
E  F#m G#m  F#m

## Bridge

E                                     F#m
And I told myself boy away you go, it rained so hard it felt like snow
G#m                                 F#m
Everything came tumbling down on me
E
In the back of the woods in the dark of the night
F#m                              G#m                    F#m
Paleness of the old moonlight everything just felt so incomplete

## Outro

&nbsp;              E     F#m
Dreaming of revelry
&nbsp;              G#m    F#m
Dreaming of revelry
&nbsp;              E     F#m
Dreaming of revelry
&nbsp;              G#m    F#m
Dreaming of revelry
