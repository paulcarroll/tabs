       Am               F

## Verse

```
          Am           F
We could live, for a thousand years,
          Dm                 F
But if I hurt you, I'd make wine from your tears.
    Am           F
I told you, that we could fly,
          Dm                   F
'Cause we all have wings, but some of us don't know w-h-y.
```

I, I was standing, you were there,
               C    F               G
Two worlds collided, and they could never, ever tear us apart...

Am F Dm F

## Chorus

```
I,             I was standing,             you were there,
 [Don't ask me]          [you know its true]          [worlds colliding]

Two worlds collided,               and they could never tear us apart...
                  [shining through]

You,        you were standing,              you were there,
[Don't ask me]             [you know its true]        [worlds colliding]

Two worlds collided,             and they could never tear us apart...
                  [shining through]
