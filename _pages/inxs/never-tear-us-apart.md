       Am               F

## Verse

```
          Am           F
We could live, for a thousand years,
          Dm                 F
But if I hurt you, I'd make wine from your tears.
    Am           F
I told you, that we could fly,
          Dm                   F
'Cause we all have wings, but some of us don't know w-h-y.
```

## Chorus

```
C F       C       F         C     F
I, I was standing, you were there,
               C    F               G
Two worlds collided, and they could never, ever tear us apart...
