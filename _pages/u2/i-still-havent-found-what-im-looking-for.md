## Verse

&nbsp;      C
I have climbed highest mountains

I have run through the fields
&nbsp;       Fsus2                C
only to be with you, only to be with you
&nbsp;     C
I have run, I have crawled
&nbsp;                                          Fsus2
I have scaled these city walls, these city walls
&nbsp;       C
only to be with you

## Chorus

G             Fsus2          C
But I still haven't found what I'm looking for
G             Fsus2          C
But I still haven't found what I'm looking for

## Verse

&nbsp;  C
I have kissed honey lips

Felt the healing in her fingertips
&nbsp;              Fsus2                C
It burned like fire, this burning desire
&nbsp;      C
I have spoke with the tongue of angels

I have held the hand of the devil
&nbsp;                  Fsus2                  C
It was warm in the night, I was cold as a stone

## Chorus

&nbsp;     G             Fsus2          C
But I still haven't found what I'm looking for
&nbsp;     G             Fsus2          C
But I still haven't found what I'm looking for

## Verse

C
I believe in the kingdom come

then all the colours they will
&nbsp;                          Fsus2
bleed into one, bleed into one
&nbsp;                 C
But yes I'm still running
&nbsp;                     C
You broke the bonds and you loosed the chains
&nbsp;                                        Fsus2
carried the cross of, of my shame, of my shame
&nbsp;            C
You know I believe it

## Chorus

&nbsp;     G             Fsus2          C
But I still haven't found what I'm looking for
&nbsp;     G             Fsus2          C
But I still haven't found what I'm looking for
&nbsp;     G             Fsus2          C
But I still haven't found what I'm looking for
&nbsp;     G             Fsus2          C
But I still haven't found what I'm looking for
