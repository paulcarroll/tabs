## Intro
 
Am  Dsus2  Fmaj7  G
 
## Verse 1
 
Am              Dsus2
  Is it getting better        
Fmaj7                   G
     Or do you feel the same
Am                Dsus2
  Will it make it easier on you now
Fmaj7                      G
     you've got someone to blame
 
         C        Am
You say   one love  one life
Fmaj7                  C
     When its one need  in the night
C         Am
  One love  we get to share it 
Fmaj7                         C              Am  Dsus2 Fmaj7 G
     It leaves you baby if you dont care for it
 
 
## Verse 2
 
Am           Dsus2
  Did I disappoint you
Fmaj7                              G
     Or leave a bad taste in your mouth
Am                       Dsus2
  You act like you never had love
Fmaj7                          G
     and you want me to go without
 
         C        Am
Well it's too late  tonight
Fmaj7                       C
     To drag the past out into the light
C                   Am
We're one, but we're  not the same
         Fmaj7                    C
We get to     carry each other carry each other
  Am  Dsus2 Fmaj7 G
One
 
## Verse 3
 
Am                          Dsus2
  Have you come here for forgiveness?
Fmaj7                           G
     Have you come to raise the dead?
Am                           Dsus2
  Have you come here to play Jesus
Fmaj7                      G
     To the lepers in your head?
 
C                  Am
 Did I ask too much  more than a lot
Fmaj7                            C
     You gave me nothing now it's all I got
C                    Am
  We're one but we're  not the same
       Fmaj7                        C
Well we     hurt each other then we do it again
 
## Chorus
 
       C                   Am
You Say Love is a temple, Love a higher law
 C                 Am
Love is a temple, Love the higher law
    C                    G
You ask me to enter, but then you make me crawl
                         Fmaj7
And I can't be holding on     to what you got
                     C           Am
When all you got is hurt one love  one blood
Fmaj7                    C
     One life you got to do what you should
        Am               Fmaj7       C
One life  with each other     Sisters brothers
                  Am
One life but we're  not the same
         Fmaj7                    C
We get to     carry each other carry each other
  C  Am  Fmaj7  C     C  Am  Fmaj7  C
One    One          One    One
