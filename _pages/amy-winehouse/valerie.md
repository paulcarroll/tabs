## Verse

&nbsp;   C                                                  Dm
Well sometimes I go out by myself and I look across the water
&nbsp;   C                                                                     Dm
And I think of all the things, what you're doing and in my head I paint a picture

## Chorus

&nbsp;     F                                Em
'Cos since I've come on home, well my body's been a mess
&nbsp;        F                                   Em
And I've missed your ginger hair and the way you like to dress
F                            Em                   G
Won't you come on over, stop making a fool out of me
&nbsp;                                  C             Dm           C             Dm
Why don't you come on over Va-a-lerie, Valerie-e-ee, Va-a-alerie, Valerie-e-ee

## Verse

&nbsp;       C                                                                     Dm
Did you have to go to jail, put your house on up for sale, did you get a good lawyer
&nbsp;          C                                                                Dm
I hope you didn't catch a tan, I hope you found the right man who'll fix it for ya
&nbsp;       C                                                           Dm
Are you shoppin' anywhere, changed the colour of your hair, are you busy?
&nbsp;           C                                                                Dm
And did you have to pay that fine you was dodging all the time are you still dizzy
&nbsp;     Dm
still dizzy?

## Chorus

And I've missed your ginger hair and the way you like to dress
F                            Em                   G
Won't you come on over, stop making a fool out of me
&nbsp;                                  C             Dm           C             Dm
