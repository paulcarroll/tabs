## Verse
D                              A
Hey, don't write yourself off yet.
&nbsp;                           G                        D
It's only in your head you feel left out or looked down on.
&nbsp;              D                        A
Just try your best, try everything you can.
&nbsp;                              G                               D
And don't you worry what they tell themselves       when you're away.

## Chorus
&nbsp;       N.C.  D                                           A
It just takes some time, little girl you're in the middle of the ride, everything,
&nbsp;               G                                         D
Everything will be just fine, everything, everything will be alright (alright)

## Verse
D                              A
Hey, you know they're all the same.
&nbsp;                            G                         D
You know you're doing better on your own, so don't buy in.
&nbsp;           D                            A
Live right now.       Yeah, just be yourself.
&nbsp;                           G                        D
It doesn't matter if it's good enough       for someone else.

## Chorus
&nbsp;       N.C.  D                                           A
It just takes some time, little girl you're in the middle of the ride, everything,
&nbsp;               G                                         D
Everything will be just fine, everything, everything will be alright (alright)
&nbsp;       N.C.  D                                           A
It just takes some time, little girl you're in the middle of the ride, everything,
&nbsp;               G                                         D
Everything will be just fine, everything, everything will be alright (alright)

&nbsp;                             G                         D
And don't you worry what the bitter hearts     are gonna say.
