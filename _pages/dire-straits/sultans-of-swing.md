## Intro

Dm

## Verse

&nbsp;         Dm
You get a shiver in the dark
&nbsp;    C            Bb           A        A7
it's a raining in the park but meantime
Dm                     C              Bb      A      A
South of the river you stop and you hold everything
F                                  C
&nbsp;  A band is blowing Dixie double fourtime
Bb                                         Dm     Bb  C
 You feel alright when you hear the music ring

## Verse

&nbsp;       Dm              C         Bb           A      A
Now you step inside but you don't see too many faces
Dm                    C                Bb   A
 coming in out of the rain to hear the jazz go down
F                        C
&nbsp;  Competition in other places
Bb                                        Dm
&nbsp;  Er, but the horns they're blowing that sound
Bb  C                   Bb  C
&nbsp;       way on downsouth,      way on downsouth,
Dm          C  Bb    C   C   Dm  C Bb    C
London town

## Verse

&nbsp;            Dm            C   Bb   A                    A7
You check out Guitar George,    he knows  all the chords,
Dm                          C           Bb             A           A
 mind he's strictly rhythm, he doesn't want to make it cry or sing
F                            C
&nbsp;  Yes and an old guitar is all he can afford
Bb                                              Dm     Bb  C
&nbsp; when he gets up under the lights to play his thing

## Verse

Dm             C         Bb        A                   A
&nbsp; And Harry doesn't mind  if he doesn't make the scene
&nbsp; Dm                 C    Bb        A         A7
&nbsp; he's got a daytime job he's doing alright
F                                 C
&nbsp; He can play the honkytonk like anything
Bb                          Dm
&nbsp; saving it up   Friday night
Bb  C                    Bb  C
&nbsp;       with the Sultans,        with the Sultans of
Dm          C  Bb    C   C   Dm  C Bb    C
swing

## Verse

&nbsp;     Dm                       C           Bb           A7       A7
And a crowd of young boys they're fooling around in the corner
Dm                              C          Bb                A          A
 drunk and dressed in their best brown baggies and their platform soles
F                                     C
&nbsp;  They don't give a damn   about any trumpet  playing band,
Bb                                   Dm
&nbsp;  it ain't what they call rock and roll
Bb  C                   Bb  C
&nbsp;       and the Sultans,        yeah the Sultans they play
Dm          C  Bb    C        C   Dm  C Bb    C
Creole                (Creole)                   (ah, ah)

Dm                   C           Bb        A7         A7
 And then the man he steps right up to the microphone
Dm            C             Bb        A          A
 and says at last   just as the time bell rings
F                         C
&nbsp;  Goodnight   now it's time    to go home
Bb                                    Dm
 And he makes it fast  with one more thing
Bb  C                      Bb  C
