The Man s Too Strong chords
Dire Straits  1985 (Brothers In Arms)

Dm C Bb Dm  2x

&nbsp;    Dm                                    C
I am just an aging drummer boy, and in the wars I used to play
&nbsp;        Bb                                Dm
And I've called the tune to many a torture session
&nbsp;                                         C
Now they say I am a war criminal, and I'm fading away
Bb                        Dm
Father, please hear my confession

&nbsp;      G                  D
I have legalized robbery, called it belief
&nbsp;      G                          D
I have run with the money, I have hid like a thief
G                       D
Re-written history with armies and my crooks
&nbsp;        C      Am       D
Invented memories, I did burn all the books

&nbsp;         Dm
And I can still hear his laughter,
&nbsp;         C              Em
And I can still hear his song
&nbsp;             Em
The man's too big;
&nbsp;             D C   D C  Cm G
The man's too strong

Gm  D

&nbsp;      G                        D
Well I tried to be meek, I have tried to be mild
&nbsp;     G                      D
But I spat like a woman, and sulked like a child
&nbsp;      G                             D
I have lived behind walls, that have made me alone
&nbsp;           C    Am        D
Striven for peace, which I never have known

&nbsp;         Dm
And I can still hear his laughter,
&nbsp;         C              Em
And I can still hear his song
&nbsp;             Em
The man's too big;
&nbsp;             D C   D C  Cm G
The man's too strong

Gm  D

&nbsp;        G                                   D
Well the sun rose on the courtyard, and they all did hear him say
&nbsp;    G                         D
"You always was a Judas, but I got you anyway
&nbsp;   G                               D
You may have got your silver, but I swear upon my life
&nbsp;                   C       Am      D
Your sister gave me diamonds, and I gave 'em to your wife"

&nbsp;                 Dm
Oh father, please help me,
&nbsp;   C           Em
For I have done wrong
&nbsp;             Em
The man's too big;
&nbsp;             D C   D C  Cm G
The man's too strong

Gm  F  Fm  C Am  F  D

D C  D C  Cm G

Gm  F  Fm  C Am  F  Am  D
