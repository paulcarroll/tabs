[Lyrics]

## Verse
&nbsp;         G
I was walking down the street,
&nbsp;              Bb
When out the corner of my eye
&nbsp;         C                   Bb      F
I saw a pretty little thing approaching me.
&nbsp;               G
She said "I've never seen a man
&nbsp;     Bb
Who looks so all alone,
&nbsp;           C          Bb    F
Could you use a little company?
&nbsp;       G
If you pay the right price
&nbsp;      Bb
Your evening will be nice,
&nbsp;           C                 Bb     F
And you can go and send me on my way."
&nbsp;                G
I said "You're such a sweet young thing
&nbsp;       Bb
Why you do this to yourself?"
&nbsp;     C               Bb                F
She looked at me and this is what she said,

## Chorus
 G                                 Bb C F
"Oh, there ain't no rest for the wicked,
 G                  Bb C F
Money don't grow on trees.
&nbsp;  G
I got bills to pay,
&nbsp;      Bb C F
I got mouths to feed,
&nbsp;            G                       Bb C F
There ain't nothing in this world for free.
&nbsp;        G
I know I can't slow down,
&nbsp;  Bb C F
I can't hold back,
&nbsp;           G                  Bb C F
Though you know, I wish I could.
&nbsp;         G                      Bb C F
No there ain't no rest for the wicked,
&nbsp;        G                    Bb C F
Until we close our eyes for good".

## Verse
&nbsp;         G
Not even fifteen minutes later
&nbsp;              Bb
I'm still walking down the street,
&nbsp;         C                   Bb      F
When I saw a shadow of a man creep out of sight.
&nbsp;               G
Then he walks up from behind
&nbsp;     Bb
And puts a gun up to my head,
&nbsp;           C          Bb    F
He made it clear he wasn't looking for a fight.
&nbsp;              G
He said "Give me all you've got
&nbsp;     Bb
I want your money not your life,
&nbsp;           C          Bb    F
But if you try to make a move I won't think twice."
&nbsp;              Bb
I said "You can have my cash
&nbsp;     Bb
But first you know I got to ask
&nbsp;           C          Bb    F
What made you want to live this kind of life?"

## Chorus
 G                                 Bb C F
He said "There ain't no rest for the wicked,
 G                     Bb C F
Money don't grow on trees.
&nbsp;  G
I got bills to pay,
&nbsp;      Bb C F
I got mouths to feed,
&nbsp;           G                       Bb C F
There ain't nothing in this world for free.
&nbsp;        G
I know I can't slow down,
&nbsp;  Bb C F
I can't hold back,
&nbsp;           G                  Bb C F
Though you know, I wish I could.
&nbsp;         G                      Bb C F
No there ain't no rest for the wicked,
&nbsp;        G                    Bb C F
Until we close our eyes for good".

## Verse
&nbsp;         G
Now a couple hours passed
&nbsp;              Bb
And I was sitting at my house,
&nbsp;           C          Bb    F
The day was winding down and coming to an end.
&nbsp;         G
So I turned on the TV
&nbsp;              Bb
And flipped it over to the news,
&nbsp;           C          Bb    F
And what I saw I almost couldn't comprehend.
&nbsp;         G                                      Bb
I saw a preacher man in cuffs he'd taken money from the church,
&nbsp;           C          Bb    F
He's got this bank account with righteous dollar bills.
&nbsp;              G
But even still I can't say much
&nbsp;              Bb
Because I know we're all the same,
&nbsp;           C          Bb    F
Oh yes we all seek out to satisfy those thrills.

## Chorus
 G                                 Bb C F
"Oh, there ain't no rest for the wicked,
 G                  Bb C F
Money don't grow on trees.
&nbsp;  G
I got bills to pay,
&nbsp;      Bb C F
I got mouths to feed,
&nbsp;            G                       Bb C F
There ain't nothing in this world for free.
&nbsp;        G
Oh no we can't slow down,
&nbsp;  Bb C F
We can't hold back,
&nbsp;           G                  Bb C F
Though you know, we wish we could.
&nbsp;         G                      Bb C F
No there ain't no rest for the wicked,
&nbsp;        G                    Bb C F
Until we close our eyes for good".
