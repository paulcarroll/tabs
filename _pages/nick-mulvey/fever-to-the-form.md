## Verse

```
                 F
So whether music or madness
                      Am
We live by one of the two
                 G
By one of the two
 
                            F
So go on, fill your heart up with gladness
                     Am
Not a moment too soon
                     G
Not a moment too soon
 
                   F
Should we ration the reasons
                          Am
To the charts that ignore
                            G
Of this I've never been sure
 
                  F
So i will follow the feeling
                          Am
And sing fever to the form
                         G
Oh my fever to the form
```

## Interlude

```
(interlude depends on version - repeat chord progression as required)
 
Fever to the form
Fever to the form
  
                                F
Cos' the very thing you're afraid, afraid of
                              Am
It keeps you clean but unclear
                    G
Clean but unclear
 
                               F
Is the dirt that you're made, you're made of
                         Am
And thats nothing to fear
                         G
No, its nothing my dear
 
                     F
How did i know what you're thinking
                Am                  G
Maybe i thought it before
 
               F                         F
Maybe that's why i'm at your window
            Am
Hear me at your door
                     G
Singing give me some more
 
G
 
                  F
Oh fever to the form
                  Am
Won't you hear me at your door
                         G
Singing give me some more
 
                        F
Cos' you were never empty
                           Am
And we've been here before
                               G
Yes, we've been here before
 
                        F
But now theres always plenty
                    Am
Yet still we ask for more
                         G
Singing fever to the form
 
(repeat chord progression to fade)
