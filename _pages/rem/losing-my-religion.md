## Intro

```
F           Dm G     Am    Am/B     Am/C   Am/D Am
F           Dm G     Am       G
```

## Verse

```
    Am              Em
Oh, life is bigger

It's bigger than you
            Am
And you are not me.
                        Em
The lengths that I will go to,
                     Am      Em
The distance in your eyes,
                     Dm
Oh no, I've said too much,
         G
I set it up.
```

## Chorus

```
                 Am
That's me in the corner,
                 Em
That's me in the spotlight
            Am
Losing my religion.
          Em
Trying to keep up with you.
      Am                          Em
And I don't know if I can do it.
                     Dm
Oh no, I've said too much,
                G
I haven't said enough.
```

## Bridge

```
  G                        F
I thought that I heard you laughing,
  Dm             G         Am   Am/B   Am/C   Am/D
I thought that I heard you sing.
Am   F               Dm   G   Am     G
I  think I thought I saw  you try.
```

## Verse

```
          Am                   Em
Every whisper of every waking hour
                   Am
I'm choosing my confessions,
          Em
Trying to keep an eye on you
       Am                                 Em
Like a hurt lost and blinded fool, fool
                     Dm
Oh no, I've said too much,
         G
I set it up.
```

## Verse

```
         Am
Consider this, consider this,
    Em
The hint of a century,
         Am
Consider this: the slip
     Em
That brought me to my knees failed.
Am
What if all these fantasies
     Em
Come    flailing around?
         Dm       G
Now I've said too much.
```

## Bridge

```
    G                       F
I thought that I heard you laughing,
        Dm        G         Am   Am/B   Am/C   Am/D
I thought that I heard you sing.
Am   F               Dm  G   Am    G
I  think I thought I saw you try.
