## Intro

```chordpro
F           Dm G     Am    Am/B     Am/C   Am/D Am
F           Dm G     Am       G
```

## Verse

&nbsp;   Am              Em
Oh, life is bigger

It's bigger than you
&nbsp;           Am
And you are not me.
&nbsp;                       Em
The lengths that I will go to,
&nbsp;                    Am      Em
The distance in your eyes,
&nbsp;                    Dm
Oh no, I've said too much,
&nbsp;        G
I set it up.

## Chorus

&nbsp;                Am
That's me in the corner,
&nbsp;                Em
That's me in the spotlight
&nbsp;           Am
Losing my religion.
&nbsp;         Em
Trying to keep up with you.
&nbsp;     Am                          Em
And I don't know if I can do it.
&nbsp;                    Dm
Oh no, I've said too much,
&nbsp;               G
I haven't said enough.

## Bridge

&nbsp; G                        F
I thought that I heard you laughing,
&nbsp; Dm             G         Am   Am/B   Am/C   Am/D
I thought that I heard you sing.
Am   F               Dm   G   Am     G
I  think I thought I saw  you try.

## Verse

&nbsp;         Am                   Em
Every whisper of every waking hour
&nbsp;                  Am
I'm choosing my confessions,
&nbsp;         Em
Trying to keep an eye on you
&nbsp;      Am                                 Em
Like a hurt lost and blinded fool, fool
&nbsp;                    Dm
Oh no, I've said too much,
&nbsp;        G
I set it up.

## Verse

&nbsp;        Am
Consider this, consider this,
&nbsp;   Em
The hint of a century,
&nbsp;        Am
Consider this: the slip
&nbsp;    Em
That brought me to my knees failed.
Am
What if all these fantasies
&nbsp;    Em
Come    flailing around?
&nbsp;        Dm       G
Now I've said too much.

## Bridge

&nbsp;   G                       F
I thought that I heard you laughing,
&nbsp;       Dm        G         Am   Am/B   Am/C   Am/D
I thought that I heard you sing.
Am   F               Dm  G   Am    G
I  think I thought I saw you try.

That was just a dream,    just a dream, just a dream, dream.
