C, Em, Am, C/G
&nbsp;    C      Em           Am
It's nine o clock on a saturday
C/G  F       C/E             D7
The regular crowd shuffles in
G           C#     Em        Am         C/G
There's an old man sitting next to me
C/G    F           G11       C     F  Cmaj7  G11
Makin' love to his tonic and gin
G11      C           Em        Am        C/G
He says "son can you play me a memory?"
C/G F          C/E         D7        G
I'm not really sure how it goes
G         C          Em          Am       C/G
But it's sad and its sweet and I knew it complete
C/G  F        G11          C
When I wore a younger mans clothes
## Chorus

Sing us a song, you're the piano man
F         C/E     D7
Sing us a song to-night
G           C          Em          Am
well, we're all in the mood for a melody
C/G  F            G11         C     F Cmaj7
and you've got us feelin' al-right

&nbsp;   C           Em       Am
Now john at the bar is a friend of mine
C/G F          C/E        D7
He  gets me my drinks for free
G       C            Em         Am            C/G
And hes quick with a joke or to light up your smoke
C/G        F              G11         C     F Cmaj7
But theres someplace that he'd rather be
G11      C/E         Em           Am
He says, bill, I be-lieve this is killing me.
C/G    F          C/E          D7
As a  smile ran a-way from his face
G       C           Em         Am    C/G
Well Im sure that I could be a movie star
C/G  F           G11         C
If   I could get out of this place
## Chorus

&nbsp;   C         Em          Am
Now paul is a real estate novelist
C/G  F         C/E        D7     G
Who  never had time for a wife
G       C           Em        Am           C/G
And hes talkin with davy whos still in the navy
C/G  F        G11         C      F  Cmaj7
And  probably will be for life
G11     C           Em         Am
And the waitress is practicing politics
C/G      F           C/E        D7
As   the businessmen slowly get stoned
G           C         Em               Am    C/G
Yes, theyre sharing a drink they call loneli-ness
C/G     F           G11        C
But its better than drinkin a-lone
## Chorus

Its a pretty good crowd for a saturday
C/G     F       C/E        D7     G
And the manager gives me a smile
G        C              Em              Am       C/G
cause he knows that its me they've been comin to see
C/G      F         G11        C      F Cmaj7
To   for-get about life for a while
G11     C     Em            Am       C/G
And the piano sounds like a carnival
C/G     F          C/E           D7
And the microphone smells like a beer
G        C          Em          Am          C/G
And they sit at the bar and put bread in my jar
C/G      F             G11       C
And say, man, what are you doin' here?
