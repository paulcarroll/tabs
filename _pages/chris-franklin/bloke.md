## Intro

A E D, A E D

## Verse
&nbsp;       A                    E D                    A                     E D
I hate the new age guys,  I'm a chauvinist, I live on beer and pies.
&nbsp;                          F#
Tried to tell you, but you look at me, like maybe,
&nbsp;        B              D
I'm an angel underneath, I haven't brushed me teeth.
&nbsp;       A                    E D                    A                     E D
Yesterday I lied, but all me mates gave me a real good alibi, thanks guys.
&nbsp;                          F#
I really went out drinking, I told you I was at work
Don't ask me for commitment, 'cause it's something I will shirk...

## Chorus

&nbsp;       A                          E
I'm a bloke, I'm an ocker, and I really love your knockers.
&nbsp;     B                  D
I'm a labourer by day, I piss up all me pay.
&nbsp;        A                 E
Watching footy on TV, just feed me more VB
&nbsp;            F#                             D
Just pour my beer and get my smokes and go away...

## Verse

&nbsp;       A                    E D                                       A              E D
Or take me as I am,                           this may mean you'll have to fetch another can.
&nbsp;                          F#                      B
Rest assured, that if I start to make you breakfast, I'm going to extremes.
     D                                           D
But tomorrow I'll get shitfaced, and today won't mean a thing...

## Chorus

&nbsp;       A                          E
I'm a bloke, I'm a yobbo and me best mate's name is Robbo.
&nbsp;     B                  D
Winfield is me cigarette, I dress in flannelette.
&nbsp;        A                 E
Shearer's singlet that is blue, throw in a few tattoos
&nbsp;            F#                             D
You know you wouldn't want me any other way...

## Bridge

&nbsp;   A                     E                          F#                  D
When you think, you've got me figured out, the season's already changing.
&nbsp;   A                           E                       F#                 D
I think it's cool, when I act like a tool, and my mates try to shave me...

## Chorus

&nbsp;       A                          E
I'm a bloke, I'm an ocker, and I really love your knockers.
&nbsp;     B                  D
I'm a labourer by day, I piss up all me pay.
&nbsp;        A                 E
Watching footy on TV, just feed me more VB
&nbsp;            F#                             D
Just pour my beer and get my smokes and go away...

## Chorus

I'm a bloke, I'm a yobbo and me best mate's name is Robbo.
&nbsp;     B                  D
Winfield is me cigarette, I dress in flannelette.
&nbsp;        A                 E
Shearer's singlet that is blue, throw in a few tattoos
&nbsp;            F#                             D
You know you wouldn't want me any other way...
