 E B A x4

E               B      A         E
Morning, it’s another pure grey morning
B                    A      E
Don’t know what the day is holding
&nbsp;       B      A
When I get uptight
&nbsp;       E                  B           A      (E)
And I walk right into the path of a lightning bolt

Link: E B A x2

E             B    A         E
Sirens of an ambulance comes howling
&nbsp;        B          A       E
Right through the centre of town and
&nbsp;        B        A
No one blinks an eye
&nbsp;      E                         B          A      (E)
And I look up to the sky in the path of a lighting bolt

E               B      A      E
Met her as the angels parted for her
&nbsp;        B    A          E
But she only brought me torture
&nbsp;    B           A
But that’s what happens
&nbsp;          E                         B         A        (E)
When it’s you who’s standing in the path of a lightning bolt

A                            Asus4
Everyone I see just wants to walk with gritted teeth
E
But I just stand by and I wait my time
A                                            Asus4
They say you gotta toe the line they want the water not the wine
&nbsp;          E               B             A            (E)
But when I see the signs I jump on that lightning bolt

E                B        A           E
Chances, people tell you not to take chances
&nbsp;          B              A          E
When they tell you there aren’t any answers
&nbsp;   B       A          E
And I was starting to agree
&nbsp;                            B           A      (E)
But I awoke suddenly in the path of a lightning bolt

E                 B      A         E
Fortune, people talking all about fortune
&nbsp;       B          A            E
Do you make it or does it just call you
&nbsp;       B             A
In the blinking of an eye
&nbsp;      E                       B         A         E
Just another passer by in the path of a lightning bolt

E                     B     A            E
It was silent, I was lying back gazing skyward
B         A            E
When the moment got shattered
&nbsp;    B                 A
I remembered what she said
&nbsp;             E           B         A         E
And then she fled in the path of a lightning bolt
