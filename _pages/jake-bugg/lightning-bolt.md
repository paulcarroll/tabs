 E B A x4 

E               B      A         E
Morning, it’s another pure grey morning
B                    A      E
Don’t know what the day is holding
        B      A
When I get uptight
        E                  B           A      (E)
And I walk right into the path of a lightning bolt

E             B    A         E
Sirens of an ambulance comes howling
         B          A       E
Right through the centre of town and
         B        A
No one blinks an eye
       E                         B          A      (E)
And I look up to the sky in the path of a lighting bolt

E               B      A      E
Met her as the angels parted for her
         B    A          E
But she only brought me torture
     B           A
But that’s what happens
           E                         B         A        (E)
When it’s you who’s standing in the path of a lightning bolt

A                            Asus4
Everyone I see just wants to walk with gritted teeth
E
But I just stand by and I wait my time
A                                            Asus4
They say you gotta toe the line they want the water not the wine
           E               B             A            (E)
But when I see the signs I jump on that lightning bolt

E                B        A           E
Chances, people tell you not to take chances
           B              A          E
When they tell you there aren’t any answers
    B       A          E
And I was starting to agree
                             B           A      (E)
But I awoke suddenly in the path of a lightning bolt

E                 B      A         E
Fortune, people talking all about fortune
        B          A            E
Do you make it or does it just call you
        B             A
In the blinking of an eye
       E                       B         A         E
Just another passer by in the path of a lightning bolt

E                     B     A            E
It was silent, I was lying back gazing skyward
B         A            E
When the moment got shattered
     B                 A
I remembered what she said
              E           B         A         E
And then she fled in the path of a lightning bolt
