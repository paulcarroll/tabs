D         A   G    D       D     A       G      D
I see the bad moon rising, I see trouble on the way,
D     A    G          D          D     A   G     D
I see earthquakes and lightning, I see bad times today.

Don't go around tonight, well it's bound to take your life,

There's a bad moon on the rise.

D      A    G     D        D          A      G      D
I hear hurricanes blowing, I know the end is coming soon,
D      A      G   D        D          A        G        D
I fear rivers overflowing, I hear the voice of rage and ruin.

Don't go around tonight, well it's bound to take your life,

There's a bad moon on the rise.

Looks like we're in for nasty weather, one eye is taken for an eye.
