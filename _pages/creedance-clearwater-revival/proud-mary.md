Left a good job in the city,

Workin' for the man every night and day,

And I never lost one minute of sleepin',

Worryin' 'bout the way things might have been,
A                            Bm
Big wheel a-keep on turnin', Proud Mary keep on burnin',
&nbsp; D
Rollin', rollin', rollin' on the river...

## Verse

D
Cleaned a lot of plates in Memphis,
D
Pumped a lot of pain down in New Orleans,
D
But I never saw the good side of the city,
&nbsp; D
'Till I hitched a ride on a river boat queen,
A                           Bm
Big wheel a-keep on turnin, Proud Mary keep on burnin',

Rollin', rollin, rollin on the river...

If you come down to the river,

Bet you're gonna find some people who live,
