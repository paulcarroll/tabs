	Left a good job in the city,
	D
	Workin' for the man every night and day,
	D
	And I never lost one minute of sleepin',
	D
	Worryin' 'bout the way things might have been,
	A                            Bm
	Big wheel a-keep on turnin', Proud Mary keep on burnin',
	 D
	Rollin', rollin', rollin' on the river...

	D
	Cleaned a lot of plates in Memphis,
	D
	Pumped a lot of pain down in New Orleans,
	D
	But I never saw the good side of the city,
	 D
	'Till I hitched a ride on a river boat queen,
	A                           Bm
	Big wheel a-keep on turnin, Proud Mary keep on burnin',
	 D
	Rollin', rollin, rollin on the river...

	If you come down to the river,
	D
	Bet you're gonna find some people who live,

	D
	People on the river are happy to give,
