	C C

	C                Am                      Em          G
	Somewhere deep inside, something's got a hold on you,
	         C           Am                         Em   G
	And it's pushing me aside, see it stretch on forever.
	                C     C7                         F
	And I know I'm  r i g h t, for the first time in my life,
	             G                              C.
	That's why I tell you, you'd better be home soon.

&nbsp;    C                   Am                    Em     G
	Stripping back the coats, of lies and deception,
	C	         Am		     	          Em     G
	Back to nothingness, like a week in the desert.
	                C     C7                         F
	And I know I'm  r i g h t, for the first time in my life,
	             G                              C      C
	That's why I tell you, you'd better be home soon...

Refrain:

	Bb           D                       G
	   Don't say no, don't say nothing's wrong,
	Bb                         A                   D     C
	  'Cause when you get back home, maybe I'll be gone, ohh...

## Instrumental
	(C) Am Em G, C Am Em, F F, Bb Bb,

	C		     Am	 		 Em	  G
	 It may cause me pain, if we were to end it,
	     C              Am            Em           G
	 But I could start again, you can depend on it,

## Chorus

	                C     C7                         F
	And I know I'm  r i g h t, for the first time in my life,
	             G                              Am    D7
	That's why I tell you, you'd better be home soon, ohh,
	             F        G                       C
	That's why I tell you, you'd better be home,  s o o n.
