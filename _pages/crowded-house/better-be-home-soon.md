## Intro

C C

## Verse

C                Am                      Em          G
Somewhere deep inside, something's got a hold on you,
&nbsp;            C           Am                         Em   G
And it's pushing me aside, see it stretch on forever.
&nbsp;             C     C7                         F
And I know I'm  r i g h t, for the first time in my life,
&nbsp;              G                              C.
That's why I tell you, you'd better be home soon.

## Verse

&nbsp;    C                   Am                    Em     G
Stripping back the coats, of lies and deception,
C          Am                   Em     G
Back to nothingness, like a week in the desert.
&nbsp;               C     C7                         F
And I know I'm  r i g h t, for the first time in my life,
&nbsp;             G                              C      C
That's why I tell you, you'd better be home soon...

## Refrain

Bb           D                       G
&nbsp;   Don't say no, don't say nothing's wrong,
Bb                         A                   D     C
&nbsp; 'Cause when you get back home, maybe I'll be gone, ohh...

## Instrumental

(C) Am Em G, C Am Em, F F, Bb Bb,

## Verse

C        Am      Em   G
&nbsp; It may cause me pain, if we were to end it,
&nbsp;     C              Am            Em           G
&nbsp; But I could start again, you can depend on it,

## Chorus

&nbsp;               C     C7                         F
And I know I'm  r i g h t, for the first time in my life,
&nbsp;             G                              Am    D7
That's why I tell you, you'd better be home soon, ohh,
&nbsp;             F        G                       C
That's why I tell you, you'd better be home,  s o o n.
