## Verse

C                                 Fmaj7
Tell me all the things you would change
C                                 Fmaj7
I don't pretend to know what you want
Am                               D9
When you come around and spin my top
&nbsp;            F            E
Time and again, time and again
C                       Fmaj7
No fire where I lit my spark
C                       Fmaj7
I am not afraid of the dark
Am                         D9
Where your words devour my heart
&nbsp;                F             E
And put me to shame, put me to shame

## Chorus
G                     Dm7
Your seven worlds collide
F             G       C
Whenever I am by your side
G                   Dm7
Dust from a distant sun
F                G    C
Will shower over everyone

## Verse

C                                  Fmaj7
You're still so young to travel so far
C                          Fmaj7
Old enough to know who you are
Am                       D9
Wise enough to carry the scars
&nbsp;           F                        E
Without any blame, there's no-one to blame
C                             Fmaj7
It's easy to forget what you learned
C                            Fmaj7
Waiting for the thrill to return
Am                  D9
Feeling your desire burn
&nbsp;                F
And drawn to the flame

## Chorus

G                     Dm7
Your seven worlds collide
F             G       C
Whenever I am by your side
G                   Dm7
Dust from a distant sun
F                 G
Will shower over everyone

## Bridge

Am                   D9   F
And I'm lying on the table washed out in the flood
Am     D9               F
Like a Christian fearing vengeance from above
Am                 D9           F
I don't pretend to know what you want
But I offer love...

## Chorus

G                 Dm7
Seven worlds will collide
F             G       C
Whenever I am by your side
G                   Dm7
Dust from a distant sun
F                G    C
Will shower over everyone
