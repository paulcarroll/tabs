How many special people change

in a champagne supernova in the sky

Someday you will find me

In a champagne supernova in the sky

Wake up at dawn and ask her why

Someday you will find me

Caught beneath the landslide

In a champagne supernova, a champagne supernova

Cos people believe that they're gonna get away for the summer
