E  A  G  F#m  E

A
How many special people change
G
How many lives are living strange
F#m				                    E
Where were you while we were geting high
A
Slowly walking down the hall
G
Faster than a cannonball
F#m                                  E
Where were you while we were getting high

## Chorus
		          A
Someday you will find me
		            G
caught beneath the landslide
&nbsp;    F#m		                E
in a champagne supernova in the sky
		         A
Someday you will find me
		            G
Caught beneath the landslide
&nbsp;    F#m		                E
In a champagne supernova in the sky

A
Wake up at dawn and ask her why
G
A dreamer dreams, she never dies
F#m
Wipe that tear away now from your eye
A
Slowly walking down the hall
G
Faster than a cannonball
F#				                     E
Where were you while we were getting high

## Chorus
		          A
Someday you will find me
		            G
caught beneath the landslide
&nbsp;    F#m		                E
in a champagne supernova in the sky
		         A
Someday you will find me
		            G
Caught beneath the landslide
&nbsp;    F#m		             E
In a champagne supernova, a champagne supernova

## Bridge
&nbsp;   G2						        A2
Cos people believe that they're gonna get away for the summer
&nbsp;   G2            		    D
But you and I, we live and die, the world's still spinning round
	      E
We don't know why............why, why, why, why
