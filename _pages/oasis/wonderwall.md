## Intro

Em G D A7sus4  (x4)

## Verse

&nbsp;   Em         G                  D                      A7sus4
Today is gonna be the day that they're gonna throw it back to you,
&nbsp;   Em       G         D                A7sus4
By now you should've somehow realized what you gotta do,
&nbsp;   Em              G       D           A7sus4
I don't believe that anybody feels the way I do,
&nbsp;    C    D A7sus4
About you now...

&nbsp;   Em             G                              D               A7sus4
Backbeat the word is on the street that the fire in your heart is out,
&nbsp;   Em                G                           D               A7sus4
I'm sure you've heard it all before but you never really had a doubt,
&nbsp;   Em              G       D            A7sus4        C    D A7sus4
I don't believe that anybody feels the way I do, about you now...

## Bridge

&nbsp;   C                D             Em
And all the roads we have to walk are winding,
&nbsp;   C            D                  Em
And all the lights that lead us there are blinding,
C              D
There are many things that I,
&nbsp;     G       D      Em         D          A7sus4
Would like to say to you, but I don't know how...

## Chorus

&nbsp;       C   Em G       Em                    C     Em G
Because maybe,  you're gonna be the one that saves me,
&nbsp;   Em    C Em G          Em    C     Em G Em.
And after all,  you're my wonderwall...

&nbsp;   Em          G                  D                      A7sus4
Today was gonna be the day but they'll never throw it back to you,
&nbsp;   Em        G         D                    A7sus4
By now you should've somehow realized what you're not to do,
&nbsp;   Em              G       D            A7sus4        C    D A7sus4
I don't believe that anybody feels the way I do, about you now...

## Bridge

&nbsp;   C                  D                 Em
And all the roads that lead you there are winding,
&nbsp;   C            D                  Em
And all the lights that light the way are blinding,
C              D
There are many things that I,
&nbsp;     G       D      Em         D          A7sus4 (C)
Would like to say to you, but I don't know how...

## Chorus

&nbsp;       C   Em G       Em                    C     Em G
I said maybe,  you're gonna be the one that saves me,
&nbsp;    Em    C Em G          Em    C     Em G Em
And after all,  you're my wonderwall...

## Outro

&nbsp;      C   Em G       Em                    C     Em G
I said maybe,  you're gonna be the one that saves me,
&nbsp;  Em    C Em G          Em    C     Em G Em
And after all,  you're my wonderwall...
&nbsp;    C   Em G       Em                    C     Em G
I said maybe,  you're gonna be the one that saves me,
&nbsp;    Em                    C     Em G
You're gonna be the one that saves me,
&nbsp;    Em                    C     Em G Em, C Em G Em.
You're gonna be the one that saves me...
