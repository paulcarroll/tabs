	Em G D A7sus4  (x4)

&nbsp;   Em         G		 		         D                      A7sus4
	Today is gonna be the day that they're gonna throw it back to you,
&nbsp;   Em	     G			   D   	           A7sus4
	By now you should've somehow realized what you gotta do,
&nbsp;   Em 		         G       D	         A7sus4
	I don't believe that anybody feels the way I do,
		    C    D A7sus4
	About you now...

&nbsp;   Em             G                              D               A7sus4
	Backbeat the word is on the street that the fire in your heart is out,
&nbsp;   Em                G                           D               A7sus4
	I'm sure you've heard it all before but you never really had a doubt,
&nbsp;   Em 		         G       D 	         A7sus4        C    D A7sus4
	I don't believe that anybody feels the way I do, about you now...

## Bridge
	    C                D   	        Em
	And all the roads we have to walk are winding,
	    C  		      D                  Em
	And all the lights that lead us there are blinding,
	C              D
	There are many things that I,
	      G       D      Em         D          A7sus4
	Would like to say to you, but I don't know how...

## Chorus
	        C   Em G       Em                    C     Em G
	Because maybe,  you're gonna be the one that saves me,
	    Em    C Em G          Em    C     Em G Em.
	And after all,  you're my wonderwall...

&nbsp;   Em          G		 		         D                      A7sus4
	Today was gonna be the day but they'll never throw it back to you,
&nbsp;   Em 	     G			   D   	               A7sus4
	By now you should've somehow realized what you're not to do,
&nbsp;   Em 		         G       D 	         A7sus4        C    D A7sus4
	I don't believe that anybody feels the way I do, about you now...

	C              D
	There are many things that I,
	      G       D      Em         D          A7sus4 (C)
	Would like to say to you, but I don't know how...
