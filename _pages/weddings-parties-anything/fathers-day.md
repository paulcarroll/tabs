## Verse

&nbsp;       E               A       A       B
I haven't always been a single man
&nbsp;       E       A       A       B
I haven't always lived up here
&nbsp;       E                   A   A       B
Along with all these other single men
 E                              F#m
With a ring around my bath and a cigarette butt in my beer
&nbsp;       E               A       A       B
I haven't always been a lonely man
&nbsp;       E          A    A       B
I haven't always lived alone
&nbsp;       E                       A       A       B
You know I haven't always drunk this much
 E                                                      F#m
But Hey before you cut me down  Just try standing in my shoes
&nbsp;       A
Cause I don't have to hear one word of this no

## Chorus

&nbsp;       E
On any other day
&nbsp;  F#
I might care what you say
&nbsp;       A
But every Saturday is father's day
E
You might call it sad
F#
You might call me mad
&nbsp;       A                                E , A
But I've got one,        who calls me Dad

E       A       A       B

## Verse

&nbsp;       E                       A       A       B
And all the other blokes that live up here
&nbsp;       E               A       A       B
Know how to leave a man alone
&nbsp;       E                       A       A       B
They're not a bad old bunch that live up here
 E                                      F#m
Ah but you know that it's not family and it's not home
&nbsp;       E                       A       A       B
What of my darling wife that once I had
&nbsp;       E                               A       A       B
Well I'm pleased to say that she still talks to me
&nbsp;       E               A       A       B
But I try not to think of what went wrong
E
Cause I might say that I was right
F#m
She might say that she was right
&nbsp;       A
And the only rights I care about are visiting rights yeah

## Chorus

&nbsp;       E
On any other day
&nbsp;       F#
I might care what you say

But every Saturday is father's day

You might call it sad

&nbsp;       A
But I've got one,        who calls me Dad
