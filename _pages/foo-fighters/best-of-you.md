## Verse
&nbsp;                      C#                       A
I've got another confession to make   I'm your fool
&nbsp;                       C#                       A
Everyone's got their chains to break   Holdin' you
&nbsp;                   B               A
Were you born to resist or be abused?
&nbsp;                      C#                   Eb/E                A    A
Is someone getting the best, the best, the best, the best of you?
&nbsp;                      C#                   Eb/E                A    A
Is someone getting the best, the best, the best, the best of you?
C#                Eb/E            A
Are you gone and onto someone new?

## Verse
&nbsp;                       C#                         A
I needed somewhere to hang my head  Without your noose
&nbsp;                              C#                     A
You gave me something that I didn't have  But had no use
&nbsp;                      B                     A
I was too weak to give in   Too strong to lose
&nbsp;                    C#                          A
My heart is under arrest again   But I break loose
&nbsp;                    C#                              A
My head is giving me life or death   But I can't choose
&nbsp;                   B                 A
I swear I'll never give in   No I refuse

## Chorus
&nbsp;                      C#                  Eb/E                    A  F#
Is someone getting the best, the best, the best, the best of you?
&nbsp;                      C#                  Eb/E                    A  F#
Is someone getting the best, the best, the best, the best of you?
&nbsp;                        C#                  Eb/E                A                F#
Has someone taken your faith?  Its real, the pain you feel  You trust, you must confess
&nbsp;                      C#                 Eb/E                  A  F#
Is someone getting the best, the best, the best, the best of you?

Has someone taken your faith? Its real, the pain you feel  The life, the love  You die to heal

The hope that starts  The broken hearts   You trust, you must  Confess
&nbsp;                      C#                 Eb/E                    A  F#
Is someone getting the best, the best, the best, the best of you?

I'm getting tired of starting again   Somewhere new
