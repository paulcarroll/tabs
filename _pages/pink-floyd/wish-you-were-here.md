## Verse

C                         D
So, so you think you can tell,
&nbsp;            Am                   G
Heaven from Hell, blue skies from pain.
&nbsp;                    D                       C                    Am
Can you tell a green field from a cold steel rail, a smile from a veil,
&nbsp;                     G
Do you think you can tell?
&nbsp;                         C                   D
And did they get you to trade your heroes for ghosts,
&nbsp;               Am                    G                             D
Hot ashes for trees, hot air for a cool breeze, cold comfort for change,
&nbsp;                 C                        Am                         G
And did you exchange a walk on part in the war for a lead role in a cage?

## Verse

C                               D
How I wish, how I wish you were here.
&nbsp;          Am                                     G                  D
We're just two lost souls swimming in a fish bowl, year after year,
&nbsp;                                 C
Running over the same old ground. What have we found?
&nbsp;            Am                         G
The same old fears. Wish you were here!
