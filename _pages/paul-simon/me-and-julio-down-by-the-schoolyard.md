The mama pajama rolled out of bed,

When the papa found out, he began to shout,
&nbsp;                         A
and he started the investigation

&nbsp;                E
It's against the law;
&nbsp;                  A
it was against the law
&nbsp;             E
What the mama saw;
&nbsp;                  A
it was against the law

The mama looked down and spit on the ground,
&nbsp;                       D

The papa said oy, if I get that boy,

I'm gonna stick him in the house of detention

I'm on my way, I'm taking my time;
&nbsp;     B7         E
but I don't know where
&nbsp;          D          G          A
Goodbye to Rosie, the queen of Corona

Whoa, in a couple of days, they come and take me away,
