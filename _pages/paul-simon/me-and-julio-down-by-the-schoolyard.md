The mama pajama rolled out of bed,
&nbsp;                         D

When the papa found out, he began to shout,

&nbsp;   A
The mama looked down and spit on the ground,
&nbsp;                       D
every time my name gets mentioned
&nbsp;   E
The papa said oy, if I get that boy,
&nbsp;                                     A
I'm gonna stick him in the house of detention

Whoa, in a couple of days, they come and take me away,
&nbsp;                           D
but the press let the story leak
&nbsp;            E

but I don't know where
