Fig1>2x
&nbsp;          Fig1
Shakedown 1979
&nbsp;                        Fig1
cool kids never have the time
&nbsp;                                   F#m7sus      B        Fig1
on a live wire right up off the street, you and I should meet
&nbsp;                        Fig1
junebug skipping like a stone
&nbsp;                                   Fig1
with the headlights pointed at the dawn
&nbsp;                              F#msus    B
we were sure we'd never see an end to it all
&nbsp;   E5      Emaj7    Fig2                             E
and I don't even     care to shake these zipper blues
&nbsp;  Emaj7     Fig2                           E       Emaj7    Fig2
and we don't know just where our bones will rest to dust I   guess
&nbsp;                    F#m7sus    B          Fig1
forgotten and absorbed into the earth below
&nbsp;                               Fig1
double cross the vacant and the bored
&nbsp;                                     Fig1
they're not sure just what we have in store
&nbsp;                    F#m7sus      A
morpine city slippin dues down to see
&nbsp;    E5       Emaj7   Fig2                     E
that we don't even     care as restless as we are
&nbsp;   Emaj7    Fig2                              E
we feel the pull in the land of a thousand guilts
&nbsp;   Emaj7   Fig2                    B5
and poured  cement, lamented and assured
&nbsp;                       C#m   Amaj7/9
to the lights and towns below
B5              C#m      Amaj7/9
faster than the speed of sound
B5            C#m          Amaj7/9 F#m7sus  B        Fig1
faster than we thought we'd go, beneath the sound of hope
&nbsp;                       Fig1
Justine never knew the rules
&nbsp;                                   Fig1
hung down with the freaks and the ghouls
&nbsp;                          Fig1
no apologies ever need be made
&nbsp;                          F#m7sus
I know you better than you fake it
&nbsp;   B       E        Emaj7  Fig2                        E
to see that we don't even    care to shake these zipper blues
&nbsp;  Emaj7     Fig2                           E        Emaj7    Fig2
and we don't know just where our bones will rest, to dust I   guess
&nbsp;                 F#m7sus   B      Fig1
forgotten and absorbed into earth below
&nbsp;                               Fig1
the street heats the urgency of now
&nbsp;                         E
as you see there's no one around
