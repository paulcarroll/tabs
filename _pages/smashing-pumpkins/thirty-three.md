## Intro

```
G x3
```

## Verse

```
  C              Dsus2            G
Speak to me in a language I can hear
  C       Dsus2           G
Humor me before I have to go
  C               Dsus2         G
Deep in thought I forgive everyone
         C               Dsus2            G
as the cluttered streets greet me once again
  G                C      Dsus2
I know I can't be late
  G                       C     Dsus2
supper's waiting on the table
  G                          C    Dsus2
Tomorrow is just an excuse away
  G                                  C    Dsus2
So I turn my collar up and face the cold,       on my own. . .
  C                Dsus2            G
The earth laughs beneath my heavy feet
  C                Dsus2            G
at the blasphemy in my old jangly walk
  C                Dsus2            G
steeple guide me to my heart and home
  C               Dsus2            C
the sun is up and out and down again
```

## Chorus

```
  C
I know I'll make it
  G
love can last forever
  C
graceful swans of never
Dsus2           C
topple to the earth
  G                    C    Dsus2
and you could make it last forever,
 G                 C    Dsus2
you could make it last forever
 C
and for a moment I lose myself
 Dsus2                              G
wrapped up in the pleasure of the world
 C                      Dsus2            G
i've journeyed here and there and back again
 C                           Dsus2            G
but in the same old haunts I find my friends
 C            Dsus2       G
mysteries not ready to reveal
 C             Dsus2      C
sympathies I'm ready to return
```

## Verse

```
 C
I'll make the effort
 G
love can last forvever
 C
graceful swans of never
 Dsus2          C
topple to the earth
 Dsus2              C
tomorrow's just an excuse
 Dsus2               C      G
tomorrow's just and excuse away
 G             C    Dsus2
could make it last forever,
 G                 C    Dsus2
you could make it last forever,
 G                 C    Dsus2
you could make it last forever

you,
          G
forever  you...
