[Intro]

A F#m D D
 
 
[Verse 1]
 
A
Fool enough to almost be it
F#m                              D
Cool enough to not quite see it
       D
Doomed
A
Pick your pockets full of sorrow
F#m                            D
And run away with my tomorrow
     D
June
 
 
      B5     G        D
We'll try to ease the pain
    B5     G        D
Somehow we feel the same
      E  F#m  D
Well, no one knows
E            F#m  G
Where out secrets go
 
 
[Verse 2]
 
A
I send a heart to all my dearies
F#m                             D
When your life is oh so dreary
      D
Dream
A
I'm rumored to the straight and narrow
F#m                             D
While the harlots of my perils
       D
Scream
 
A     F#m      D             D
And I fail but when I can, I will
A           F#m               D      D
Try to understand that when I can, I will

[Verse 3]
 
A
Mother weep the years I'm missin'
F#m                          D
All our time can't be given
     D
Back
A
Shut my mouth and strike the demons
F#m
That cursed you and your reasons
D
Out of hand and out of season
D
Out of love and out of feeling
 
A  F#m             D      D
So bad that when I can, I will
A              F#m          D      D
Words defy the plan, when I can, I will
 
 
A
Fool enough to almost be it
F#m
Cool enough to not quite see it
D
Old enough to always feel it
D
Always old, I'll always feel this
A
No more promise, no more sorrow
F#m
No longer will I follow
D
Can anybody hear me
 
D              A  F#m           D      D
I just want to be me and when I can, I will
A           F#m               D      D
Try to understand that when I can, I will
