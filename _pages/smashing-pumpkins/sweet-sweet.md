## Intro

G   C   Em

## Verse

Sweet sweet sweet sweet little agony
I don't know just where you've been
But I'll take take take
All that you have for me
In sin
Where are we going?

## Chorus

And they all want you to change
And they all want you to change

## Verse

And the sad sad sad
All the sad faces drown
In this town
Where are we going?

## Verse

And they all want you to change
Where are we going?
And they all want you to change
Where are we going?
