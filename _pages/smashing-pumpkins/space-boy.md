Feel it    break your bones mr. Jones
F5 G5 B5 F5 G5 B5    F5 G5 B5 C5
Taste me as I bleed, taste my need

&nbsp;              G           Am(i)             Em(i)
Spaceboy, I've missed you, spinning round my head
C(i)       G            D        Em
Anyway you choose me, I break instead

F5 G5 B5  F5 G5 B5    F5 G5 B5 C5
Watch me, death defy, defile my life
F5 G5 B5      F5 G5 B5
I don't need, if I don't care

&nbsp; B5     C5        G5    B5     C5        G5    B5
Please  I want to  go    home..I want to  go    home..
&nbsp;       I want to  go    home, I want to go home
&nbsp; B5     C5        G5    B5     C5        G5    B5
Cause when a lover aches,   that's when a lover breaks

 C5        G5    B5     C5        G5    B5
I want to  go    home..I want to  go    home..

Spaceboy, they'll kill me

Before I'm dead and gone
C(i)            G
And anyway they choose me,

It won't be long
C(i)            G
And anyway they choose me,

We won't be long...
