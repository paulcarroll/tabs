## Verse

D
When I walk beside her
C
I am the better man
G
When I look to leave her
&nbsp;       D
I always stagger back again
D
Once I built an Ivory tower
C
so I could worship from above
G
When I climb down to be set free
&nbsp;       D
she took me in again

## Chorus

D
there's a big
&nbsp;               Am
A big hard sun
&nbsp;               G
beaten on the big people
&nbsp;               D
in the big hard world

## Verse

D
When she comes to greet me
C
She is mercy at my feet
G
When I see her pin her charm
&nbsp;       D
She just throws it back at me
D
Once I dug an early grave
C
To find a better land
G
She just smile and laughed at me
&nbsp;       D
And took her bruise back again

## Chorus

D
there's a big
&nbsp;               Am
A big hard sun
&nbsp;               G
beaten on the big people
&nbsp;               D
in the big hard world
D
there's a big
&nbsp;               Am
A big hard sun
&nbsp;               G
beaten on the big people
&nbsp;               D
in the big hard world

## Verse

D
Once I stood to lose her
C
when I saw what I had done
G
bound down and flew away the hours
&nbsp;       D
of her garden and her sun
D
so I tried to warn her
C
I turned to see her weep
G
40 days and 40 nights
&nbsp;       D
and it's still coming down on me

## Chorus

D
there's a big
&nbsp;               Am
A big hard sun
&nbsp;               G
beaten on the big people
&nbsp;               D
in the big hard world
D
there's a big
&nbsp;               Am
A big hard sun
&nbsp;               G
beaten on the big people
&nbsp;               D
in the big hard world
