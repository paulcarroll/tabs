## Verse

C
&nbsp; Hey there Delilah,
&nbsp;         Em
What’s it like in New York City?
&nbsp;     C
I’m a thousand miles away,
&nbsp;          Em
But girl tonight you look so pretty,
&nbsp;       Am   G
Yes you do,
F                   G                  Am
&nbsp; Time Square can’t shine as bright as you,
&nbsp;            G
I swear it’s true.
C
&nbsp; Hey there Delilah,
&nbsp;         Em
Don’t you worry about the distance,
&nbsp;         C
I’m right there if you get lonely,
&nbsp;         Em
Give this song another listen,
&nbsp;          Am     G
Close your eyes,
F              G                Am
&nbsp; Listen to my voice it’s my disguise,
&nbsp;           G
I’m by your side.

## Chorus

C                      Am
Oh it’s what you do to me,
C                      Am
Oh it’s what you do to me,
C                      Am
Oh it’s what you do to me,
C                      Am
Oh it’s what you do to me,
&nbsp;              C
What you do to me.

## Verse

C
&nbsp; Hey there Delilah,
&nbsp;      Em
I know times are getting hard,
&nbsp;          C
But just believe me girl some day,
&nbsp;            Em
I'll pay the bills with this guitar,
&nbsp;             Am     G
We'll have it good,
F                G               Am
&nbsp; We'll have the life we knew we would,
&nbsp;          G
My word is good.

C
&nbsp; Hey there Delilah,
&nbsp;        Em
I’ve got so much left to say,
&nbsp;        C
If every simple song I wrote to you,
&nbsp;     Em
Would take your breath away,
&nbsp;            Am    G
I’d write it all,
F              G                  Am
&nbsp; Even more in love with me you’d fall,
&nbsp;            G
We’d have it all.

## Chorus

C                      Am
Oh it’s what you do to me,
C                      Am
Oh it’s what you do to me,
C                      Am
Oh it’s what you do to me,
C                      Am
Oh it’s what you do to me,

## Bridge

&nbsp; F
A thousand miles seems pretty far,
&nbsp;   G
But they’ve got planes and trains and cars,
&nbsp;   C                             Am
I’d walk to you if I had no other way,
&nbsp;   F
Our friends would all make fun of us,
&nbsp;   G
And we'll just laugh along because,
&nbsp;  C                                     Am
We know that none of them have felt this way,
&nbsp; F
Delilah I can promise you,
&nbsp;    G
That by the time that we get through,
&nbsp;   Am
The world will never ever be the same,
&nbsp;             G
And you’re to blame.

## Verse

C                          Em
&nbsp; Hey there Delilah you be good, And don’t you miss me,
&nbsp;        C
Two more years and you’ll be done with school,
&nbsp;   Em
And I'll be making history,
&nbsp;      Am   G
Like I do,
F                  G              Am
&nbsp; You’ll know it's all because of you,
F               G            Am
&nbsp; We can do whatever we want to,
F             G               Am
&nbsp; Hey there Delilah here's to you,
&nbsp;              G
This one’s for you.

## Chorus

C                      Am
Oh it’s what you do to me,
C                      Am
Oh it’s what you do to me,
C                      Am
Oh it’s what you do to me,
C                      Am
Oh it’s what you do to me,
&nbsp;              C       Am
What you do to me.
