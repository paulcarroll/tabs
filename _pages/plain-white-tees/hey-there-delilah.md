## Verse

C
  Hey there Delilah
          Em
What’s it like in New York City?
      C
I’m a thousand miles away
           Em
But girl tonight you look so pretty
        Am   G
Yes you do
F                   G                  Am
  Time Square can’t shine as bright as you
             G
I swear it’s true
C
  Hey there Delilah
          Em
Don’t you worry about the distance
          C
I’m right there if you get lonely
          Em
Give this song another listen
           Am     G
Close your eyes
F              G                Am
  Listen to my voice it’s my disguise
            G
I’m by your side

## Chorus

C                      Am
Oh it’s what you do to me
C                      Am
Oh it’s what you do to me
C                      Am
Oh it’s what you do to me
C                      Am
Oh it’s what you do to me
               C
What you do to me.

## Verse 2

C
  Hey there Delilah
       Em
I know times are getting hard
           C
But just believe me girl some day
             Em
I'll pay the bills with this guitar
              Am     G
We'll have it good
F                G               Am
  We'll have the life we knew we would
           G
My word is good.

C
  Hey there Delilah
         Em
I’ve got so much left to say
         C
If every simple song I wrote to you
      Em
Would take your breath away
             Am    G
I’d write it all
F              G                  Am
  Even more in love with me you’d fall
             G
We’d have it all.

## Chorus 2

C                      Am
Oh it’s what you do to me
C                      Am
Oh it’s what you do to me
C                      Am
Oh it’s what you do to me
C                      Am
Oh it’s what you do to me

## Bridge

  F
A thousand miles seems pretty far
    G
But they’ve got planes and trains and cars
    C                             Am
I’d walk to you if I had no other way
    F
Our friends would all make fun of us
    G
And we'll just laugh along because
   C                                     Am
We know that none of them have felt this way
  F
Delilah I can promise you
     G
That by the time that we get through
    Am
The world will never ever be the same
              G
And you’re to blame.

## Verse 3

C                          Em
  Hey there Delilah you be good, And don’t you miss me
         C
Two more years and you’ll be done with school
    Em
And I'll be making history
       Am   G
Like I do
F                  G              Am
  You’ll know it's all because of you
F               G            Am
  We can do whatever we want to
F             G               Am
  Hey there Delilah here's to you
               G
This one’s for you.

## Chorus 3

C                      Am
Oh it’s what you do to me
C                      Am
Oh it’s what you do to me
C                      Am
Oh it’s what you do to me
C                      Am
Oh it’s what you do to me
               C       Am
What you do to me.
