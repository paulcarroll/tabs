## Intro

Em7  Am     D   G5   D/F#   Em7  x 2

## Verse

Em7    Am              D
Sister can you hear me now
    G5      D/F#    Em7
The ringing in your ears
    Am          D
I'm down on the ground
   G5          D/F#    Em7
My luck's been dry for years

## Verse

&nbsp;   Am          D
I'm lost in the dark
      G5          D/F# Em7
And I feel like a dinosaur
       Am              D
Broken face and broken hands
G5    D/F#   Em7
I'm a broken man

## Chorus

&nbsp;            Am
I've hit the wall
             D
I'm about to fall
        G5      D/F#  Em7
But I'm closing in on it
          Am
I feel so weak
            D
On a losing streak
         G5         D/F#    Em7
Watch my taillights fade to black

## Verse

&nbsp;        Am               D
I read a thing about this girl
          G5        D/F# Em7
She was a hermit in her world
    Am                  D
Her story was much like mine
          G5    D/F# Em7
She could be my valentine

## Verse

&nbsp;   Am                   D
And although we've never met
  G5       D/F#    Em7
I won't forget her yet
    Am                       D
She cut herself off from her past
    G5    D/F#     Em7
Now she's alone at last

## Chorus

&nbsp;         Am
I feel so sick
                 D
Lost love's last licks
        G5      D/F#    Em7
But I'm closing down on it
          Am
I feel so weak
            D
On a losing streak
         G5         D/F#    Em7
Watch my taillights fade to black

## Verse

&nbsp;       Am            D
Lost my life in cheap wine
G5       D/F#  Em7
Now it's quiet time
      Am             D
Cappy Dick nor Jesus Christ
G5        D/F#    Em7
Could not help my fate

## Verse

&nbsp;       Am           D
But I'm underneath a gun
    G5       D/F#    Em7
I'm singing about my past
      Am               D
Had myself a wonderful thing
      G5        D/F#    Em7
But I could not make it last

## Chorus

&nbsp;            Am
I've hit the wall
             D
I'm about to fall
        G5      D/F#  Em7
But I'm closing in on it
          Am
I feel so small
              D
Underneath it all
         G5         D/F#    Em7    Am D
Watch my taillights fade to black

## Outro

&nbsp;        G5         D/F#    Em7    Am D
Watch my taillights fade
         G5         D/F#    Em7    Am D
Watch my taillights fade
         G5         D/F#    Em7    Am D
Watch my taillights fade
