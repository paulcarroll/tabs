## Verse

A                                        Asus2           A
Still didn't know what happened when you knocked upon my door
&nbsp;   A                                           Asus2                A
The things you had, the life you lived, all the dreams you had before
&nbsp;    A                                             Asus2                A
Your eyes, your face, and your heart and soul, you know they said it all
&nbsp;    A                                   Asus2          A
What happened on that day back then, the moment hurt us all

## Pre-Chorus

F#m                 A              D              E
Now you can see the reason why not everyone's the same
&nbsp;   F#m               A                   D                 E
And you don't have to please them, or try hard to save your name

## Chorus
&nbsp;    A
They said you'd never get anywhere,
&nbsp;    C
Well they don't care and it's just not fair
&nbsp;    G                    A
That you know, and I know better.
&nbsp;    A
They said you'd never get anywhere,
&nbsp;    C
Well they don't care and it's just not fair
&nbsp;    G                    A
That you know, and I know better. (Yes I do)

Your heart said "No" but your feelings show the whole thing you never knew
