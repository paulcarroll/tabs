## Verse

&nbsp;   D5     Cadd9       E5      A        D5   Cadd9  E5   A
The weightlifter and a library tech you know
D5    Cadd9  E5             A      D5   Cadd9  E5   A
Made a big decision in the magazine row
&nbsp;     D5     Cadd9     E5              A      D5   Cadd9  E5   A
I'll open my catalogue just enough to let you in
&nbsp;    D5 (N.C.)                          D5  Cadd9 E5  A
And she'll drop beers like you drop vitamins

## Chorus

F5                                     D5
Did you ever never wanna let somebody down?
F5                                           E5                A
Was you ever thinking that you'd be Cathy's clown now she's around

## Verse

&nbsp;   D5      Cadd9         E5             A          D5  Cadd9  E5   A
The protein pills and the g-strings you left in her flat
&nbsp;   D5   Cadd9     E5              A       D5  Cadd9  E5   A
Are just enough to get your dewey decimal back
D5         Cadd9     E5             A          D5  Cadd9  E5   A
Lift her to work, before your daily workout begins
&nbsp;    D5 (N.C.)                          D5  Cadd9  E5   A
And she'll stack up like you stack vitamins

## Chorus

F5                                     D5
Did you ever never wanna let somebody down?
F5                                           E5                A
Was you ever thinking that you'd be Cathy's clown now she's around
