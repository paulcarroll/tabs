## Intro

G - F (x4)

## Verse

G                          F
Batten up the hatches, here comes the cold
G                          F
I can feel it creeping, it's making me old
G                          F                        G - F
You give me so much love that it blows my brains out
G                          F
You need something better than the bacon and eggs
G                          F
The creaking in the walls and the banging in the bed
G                          F                        G - C
You give me so much love that it blows my brains out

## Chorus

D       Bm   Cadd9                        D  
 Summer rain, dripping down your face again
        Bm   Cadd9                        D  
 Summer rain, praying someone feels the same
          Bm           Cadd9
 Take the pain killer, cycle on your bicycle
D                 Bm    Cadd9
Leave all this misery behind

## Instrumental

G - F (x4)

## Verse 2

G         F             G                        F
My love giving me head, feeling very guilty, breaking the bread
G                          F            G - F
Losing my attention, taking the world on
G                          F
So batten up the hatches, here comes the cold
G                          F
I can feel it creeping, it's making me old
G                          F                        G - C
You give me so much love that it blows my brains out

 Summer rain, praying someone feels the same
          Bm           Cadd9
 Take the pain killer, cycle on your bicycle

Leave all this misery behind
