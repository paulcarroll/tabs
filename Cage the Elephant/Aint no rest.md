[Lyrics]
 
[Verse]
          G
I was walking down the street,
               Bb
When out the corner of my eye
          C                   Bb      F
I saw a pretty little thing approaching me.
                G
She said "I've never seen a man
      Bb
Who looks so all alone,
            C          Bb    F
Could you use a little company?
        G
If you pay the right price
       Bb
Your evening will be nice,
            C                 Bb     F
And you can go and send me on my way."
                 G
I said "You're such a sweet young thing
        Bb
Why you do this to yourself?"
      C               Bb                F
She looked at me and this is what she said,
 
[Chorus]
 G                                 Bb C F
"Oh, there ain't no rest for the wicked,
 G                  Bb C F
Money don't grow on trees.
   G
I got bills to pay,
       Bb C F
I got mouths to feed,
             G                       Bb C F
There ain't nothing in this world for free.
         G
I know I can't slow down,
   Bb C F
I can't hold back,
            G                  Bb C F
Though you know, I wish I could.
          G                      Bb C F
No there ain't no rest for the wicked,
         G                    Bb C F
Until we close our eyes for good".
 
[Verse 2]
          G
Not even fifteen minutes later
               Bb
I'm still walking down the street,
          C                   Bb      F
When I saw a shadow of a man creep out of sight.
                G
Then he walks up from behind
      Bb
And puts a gun up to my head,
            C          Bb    F
He made it clear he wasn't looking for a fight.
               G
He said "Give me all you've got
      Bb
I want your money not your life,
            C          Bb    F
But if you try to make a move I won't think twice."
               Bb
I said "You can have my cash
      Bb
But first you know I got to ask
            C          Bb    F
What made you want to live this kind of life?"
 
[Chorus]
 G                                 Bb C F
He said "There ain't no rest for the wicked,
 G                     Bb C F
Money don't grow on trees.
   G
I got bills to pay,
       Bb C F
I got mouths to feed,
            G                       Bb C F
There ain't nothing in this world for free.
         G
I know I can't slow down,
   Bb C F
I can't hold back,
            G                  Bb C F
Though you know, I wish I could.
          G                      Bb C F
No there ain't no rest for the wicked,
         G                    Bb C F
Until we close our eyes for good".
 
[Verse 3]
          G
Now a couple hours passed
               Bb
And I was sitting at my house,
            C          Bb    F
The day was winding down and coming to an end.
          G
So I turned on the TV
               Bb
And flipped it over to the news,
            C          Bb    F
And what I saw I almost couldn't comprehend.
          G                                      Bb
I saw a preacher man in cuffs he'd taken money from the church,
            C          Bb    F
He's got this bank account with righteous dollar bills.
               G
But even still I can't say much
               Bb
Because I know we're all the same,
            C          Bb    F
Oh yes we all seek out to satisfy those thrills.
 
[Chorus]
 G                                 Bb C F
"Oh, there ain't no rest for the wicked,
 G                  Bb C F
Money don't grow on trees.
   G
I got bills to pay,
       Bb C F
I got mouths to feed,
             G                       Bb C F
There ain't nothing in this world for free.
         G
Oh no we can't slow down,
   Bb C F
We can't hold back,
            G                  Bb C F
Though you know, we wish we could.
          G                      Bb C F
No there ain't no rest for the wicked,
         G                    Bb C F
Until we close our eyes for good".
