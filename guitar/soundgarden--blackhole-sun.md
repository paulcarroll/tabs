Capo 3
 
[Intro]
 
E G D C#m C B
 
 
[Verse 1]
 
      E           G
In my eyes, indisposed,
       D             C#m
In disguises no one knows.
           C               B
Hides the face, lies the snake,
     E     D       F
The sun in my disgrace.
         E             G
Boiling heat, summer stench,
            D                  C#m
Neath the black the sky looks dead.
         C                 B
Call my name through the cream,
          E        D       F
And I'll hear you scream again.
 
 
[Chorus]
 
            C
Black hole sun,
           B
Won't you come,
     E     D       G
And wash away the rain.
            C
Black hole sun,
           B               A               B
Won't you come, won't you come, won't you come.
 
 
[Verse 2]
 
       E              G
Stuttering, cold and damp,
           D                C#m
Steal the warm wind tired friend.
           C               B
Times are gone for honest men,
               E      D          F
And sometimes far too long for snakes.
        E                G
In my shoes, a walking sleep,
        D               C#m
And my youth I pray to keep.
        C          B
Heaven sent hell away,
        E          D      F
No one sings like you anymore.
 
 
[Chorus]
 
            C
Black hole sun,
           B
Won't you come,
     E     D       G
And wash away the rain.
            C
Black hole sun,
           B               A    G
Won't you come, won't you come.
 
            C
Black hole sun,
           B
Won't you come,
     E     D       G
And wash away the rain.
            C
Black hole sun,
           B
Won't you come,
           A                G               B
Won't you come (Black hole sun, Black hole sun).
           A                Em              B
Won't you come (Black hole sun, Black hole sun).
           A                G               B
Won't you come (Black hole sun, Black hole sun).
           A                Em              B
Won't you come (Black hole sun, Black hole sun).
 
 
[Bridge]
 
         E              G
Hang my head, drown my fear,
         D              C#m
Till you all just disappear.
 
 
[Chorus]
 
            C
Black hole sun,
           B
Won't you come,
     E     D       G
And wash away the rain.
            C
Black hole sun,
           B               A    G
Won't you come, won't you come.
 
            C
Black hole sun,
           B
Won't you come,
     E     D       G
And wash away the rain.
            C
Black hole sun,
           B
Won't you come,
           A                G               B
Won't you come (Black hole sun, Black hole sun).
           A                G               B
Won't you come (Black hole sun, Black hole sun).
           A                G               B
Won't you come (Black hole sun, Black hole sun).
           A                G               B
Won't you come (Black hole sun, Black hole sun).
           A                G               B
Won't you come (Black hole sun, Black hole sun).
           A                G               B
Won't you come (Black hole sun, Black hole sun).
           A   G B
Won't you come,
           A   Em B  E D E
Won't you come.
