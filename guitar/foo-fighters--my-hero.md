[Intro]
 
C Am 6x
Dm F  1x
 
 
[Verse]
 
C         Am       C       Am
Too alarming now, to talk about
C           Am            C           Am
Take your pictures down, and shake it out
C            Am          C      Am
Truth or consequence, say it aloud
C            Am        C       Am
Use that evidence, race it around
 
 
[Chorus]
 
F
There goes my hero
                  C
Watch him as he goes
F
There goes my hero
            C
He's ordinary
 
 
[Post-Chorus]
 
Dm F
 
 
[Verse]
 
C         Am             C         Am
Don't the best of them, bleed it out
C         Am          C         Am
While the rest of them, peter out
C        Am          C         Am
Truth or consequence, say it aloud
C         Am       C           Am
Use that evidence, race it around
 
 
[Chorus]
 
F
There goes my hero
                  C
Watch him as he goes
F
There goes my hero
            C
He's ordinary
 
 
[Pre-Chorus]
 
Dm F
 
 
[Bridge]
 
C Am
(Throughout all instrumental part)
 
C        Am     C               Am
Kudos my hero, leaving all the mess
C           Am       C           Am
You know my hero, the one that's on
 
 
[Chorus]
 
F
There goes my hero
                  C
Watch him as he goes
F
There goes my hero
            C
He's ordinary  
 
 
F
There goes my hero
                  C
Watch him as he goes
F
There goes my hero
            C
He's ordinary
