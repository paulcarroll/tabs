A                            F#m
Her green plastic watering can 
                               D
For her fake chinese rubber plant
              A     D
In the fake plastic earth
A                               F#m 
That she bought from a rubber man
                            D 
In a town full of rubber plans
       A      D 
To get rid of itself
 
             Bm
It wears her out..
             A
It wears her out..
             Bm
It wears her out.. 
             A
It wears her out 
 
A                         F#m
She lives with a broken man 
                        D  
A cracked polystyrene man 
          A           D  
Who just crumbles and burns 
A                   F#m
He used to do surgery 
                      D  
For girls in the eighties 
            A      D 
But gravity always wins 
 
                 Bm 
And it wears him out.. 
             A
It wears him out.. 
             Bm
It wears him out.. 
      A 
It weeeeeaaaars 
 
A                            F#m
She looks like the real thing 
                           D
She tastes like the real thing 
          A     D    
My fake plastic love 
A                         F#m
But I can't help the feeling 
                             D
I could blow through the ceiling 
           A        D
If I just turn and run 
                Bm
And it wears me out 
            A
It wears me out 
            Bm
It wears me out 
            A 
It wears me out 
               Bm
And if I could be who you wanted 
           A
If I could be who you wanted 
       Bm
All the time.. 
       A
All the time..
