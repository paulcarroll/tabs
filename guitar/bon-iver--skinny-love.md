Intro
Am C x 3 G Am


Am              C
Come on skinny love just last the year
Am             C
Pour a little salt we were never here
        Am          C
My, my, my, my, my, my, my, my
               G                          Am
Staring at the sink of blood and crushed veneer
Am        C
I tell my love to wreck it all
Am              C
Cut out all the ropes and let me fall
        Am          C
My, my, my, my, my, my, my, my
             G                    Am...
Right in the moment this order's tall

{start_of_chorus}
  C
I told you to be patient
  G             F
I told you to be fine
  C
I told you to be balanced
  G              F
I told you to be kind
       C
In the morning I'll be with you
            G               F
But it will be a different "kind"
        C
I'll be holding all the tickets
              G              F
And you'll be owning all the fines



Am              C
Come on skinny love what happened here
Am            C
Suckle on the hope in lite brassiere
        Am          C
My, my, my, my, my, my, my, my
               G                     Am
Sullen load is full; so slow on the split

{start_of_chorus}
  C
I told you to be patient
  G             F
I told you to be fine
  C
I told you to be balanced
  G              F
I told you to be kind
    C
Now all your love is wasted?
     G                F
Then who the hell was I?
        C
Now I'm breaking at the britches
           G               F
And at the end of all your lines
C
Who will love you?
G         F
Who will fight?
C             G       F
Who will fall far behind?
